## Development Tools
 - [Paw](https://paw.cloud)

> Paw is a full-featured HTTP client that lets you test the APIs you build or consume. It has a beautiful native OS X interface to compose requests, inspect server responses and generate client code out-of-the-box.

 - [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop)

> Build, test, and document your APIs faster. More than a million developers already do.

 - [Instrument by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/)

> Instruments is a powerful and flexible performance-analysis and testing tool that’s part of the Xcode tool set. It’s designed to help you profile your OS X and iOS apps, processes, and devices in order to better understand and optimize their behavior and performance. Incorporating Instruments into your workflow from the beginning of the app development process can save you time later by helping you find issues early in the development cycle.

 - [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)

### UX/UI

#### Presentation
  - [Presentr](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/Presentr)
  - [Animated CollectionViewLayout](https://github.com/KelvinJin/AnimatedCollectionViewLayout)
  - [Jelly](https://github.com/SebastianBoldt/Jelly)

> Jelly provides a way to integrate different kinds of highly customizable view controller transitions into your iOS-App with just a few lines of code


#### Animation
 - [Hero](https://github.com/lkzhao/Hero)
 - [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios)
 - [LottieFiles](http://bit.ly/2mJR1TR)

> A library for iOS and Android from the developers at Airbnb that parses Adobe After Effects animations and renders the vector animations natively on mobile. Lottie can handle animations exported as JSON using the bodymovin plugin and as the animations are backed by JSON they can be complex without being huge in size. Best of all, as the animations are rendered as vectors they can be resized, looped, sped up, slowed down, and even interactively scrubbed without any loss in quality.

### Swift

#### Formatting
 - [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat/)

> Many programmers have a preferred style for formatting their code, and others seem entirely blind to the existing formatting conventions of a project. When collaborating on a project, it can be helpful to agree on a common coding style, but enforcing that manually is tedious and error-prone, and can lead to bad feeling if some participants take it more seriously than others. Having a tool to automatically enforce a common style eliminates those issues, and lets you focus on the operation of the code, not its presentation.

#### Networking & JSON
