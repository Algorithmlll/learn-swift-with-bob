### Instructor Introduction
Hello everyone! I make a living as an iOS blogger and instructor as [Bob the Developer](https://blog.bobthedeveloper.io) with over thousands of daily visitors and descent reviews from the students. I've spoken at various Swift conferences and meet ups. I try to share useful content for the community as the content distributor of the largest iOS [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/apple.ios.developers) with over 100,000 weekly reach. 

### The Why
If you've been learning Swift from other sources and you felt like you are missing out, you've come to the right place. I understand because this course is the only intermediate to advanced Swift course in the marketplace. You will not just learn how to use certain Swift features. You will why those features have been created and how you can apply in your projects.

### Student Benefits
You've heard "Swift is a protocol oriented1 programming language". You will touch upon what make `for-in` look possible through applying custom`Sequence`, `Equatable`. You will learn every case of `?` and `!` from intro to advanced error handling. You will learn how memory is managed in closures, functions, and the difference between weak and strong.  I've conducted close to thousands of surveys. I understand how you feel.

In fact, this course isn't just about Swift. You will shift how you apporach code so that you are able to create the next iOS application. Every course that I produce in the future, you are expected to every lesson here including functional proramming which was newly added in the course.

Here is the problem. Most students lack fundamentals because many courses and books focus on the final products. You've probably heard or taken, "Be a paid developer and build 21 apps just by taking one course." Give me a break. You know what happens. They end up being code monkeys, copying and pasting. I'm speaking from my experience and hundreds of personal emails before.

### What Should You Take
- I focus on every detail. My default font is 28px. No problem watching it on your smartphone.
- Your questions willl be answered at 100%
- The entire lecture note is available with source code, explanations, resources, and references as a review when you are done with the course.
- You can see my face while learning although it takes more editing effort and preparation since I have to look presentable at all times.
- My lessons are prepared from top to bottom. There is no unexpected error and you won't waste time me trying to figure out what's going on.
- You will be invited to the Slack group.
- 4.9 ratings, the highest rating.
- The best seller. Udemy approves.

### What the Students Will Do
Making a software is similar to writing a novel. You may still be able to publish your first ebook even if it is filled with wrong grammar and wrong words. Every lesson is filled with practical examples. After each lesson, you probably get an urge to fix your pre-existing code base. You don't learn something just for the sake of learning. You will and you must apply. This will only happen when you take this course with me.

### Ideal Students
This course is designed for anyone who has been programming with Swift or other similar languages such as Javascript and understand the basic concept of `Object Oriented Programming`, `else-if` and `switch` statement. If you've never programmed before, don't worry. I've attached free introductory videos for you in the lecture notes.  

### Call to Action
Unlike many other courses, the course is at $50 with no discount since I have not signed up for the Udemy marketing plan. However, if you are a student or you are an aspriring iOS developer from third-world countries, feel free to send me an email bob@bobthedeveloper.io. I will provide you with private coupon links.

You will get an invite to my private Slack group. Lastly, there is a 30-day money back guarantee so just give it a try. You have nothing to lose. If you are not convinced yet, feel free to read through the reviews, and decide.
