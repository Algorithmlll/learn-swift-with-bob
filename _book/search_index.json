I've taken online courses from major platforms. However, I have been frustrated by a lack of detailed explanation from instructors. They tend to focus on final products, thus missing out the fundamentals. I was confused by which design principles to follow, and why. Soon after I've been blogging for the last 5 months, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine. I've received hundreds of emails and questions regarding how to write code that does not violate principles such as DRY, modularity, and readability. As a result, I've decided to create this course dedicated for my younger self. I believe it all comes down to the fundamentals which I lacked in the beginning.\nReference\nThis is a platform for my students to download the source code, lecture notes, and scripts. As a life-long student, I've always wanted to have a complete overview of what I've learned. Most instructors avoid documenting since it takes effort besides making videos alone. I chose the road less traveled to help my students and differentiate myself from the competitive marketplace.\n\nUntil the course get officially released, please consider it as a rough draft.\n\nPersonal Motivation\nI feel grateful for what learning offers in my life. It would have been impossible for me to create this course and communicate in English. I've decided to devote my career providing affordable education channels for all people globally. As a person who has lived in third world countries and also attended college in NYC, I understand, education is the way for anyone rise up and increase a standard of living and quality of life. To pursue this grand goal, I have started off with teaching iOS development to raise funds and increase my personal brand.\nMailing List\nIf you are interested in receiving regular updates on upcoming courses with discounts, you easily sign up through the button below.

This monitor doesn't require a power cord. It only needs a USB port. It's useful for client meetings as well.\nMonitor\n\n\nAcer 23.8 Inch Monitor\nIt's affordable, and I use it to record tutorials and any other activities.  An extra monitor is a must for anyone who is serious about programming.\nMonitor\n\n\nApple's Magic Keyboard\nIt prevents a neck-strain because I no longer have to turn my next to see the side monitor. There is no delay time between input and output. Also, there is a rechargeable battery so I get to save time.\nKeyboard\n\n\nApple's Magic Mouse 2\nIt looks aesthetic, and I love the fact that it is so thin that I can carry it in my pocket otherwise I had to carry a small bag. Similar to the keyboard above, it doesn't require any extra battery cells, so there is no recurring fee or time spent on going to the supermarket.\nMouse\n\n\n2013 MacBook Pro 15 Inch\nI don't think I have to explain. The link provides the cheapest offer for now. It is around $800 which is pretty good deal considering I can probably use it for another 3 year. So, you'd only pay like $250 per year which is affordable.\nLaptop\n\n\n\n\nThe cheaper ones are refurbished. I'd recommend you to get a new one since it just feels better and you are going to use them for another 2-3 years. If you spot anything cheaper, make sure it is not the first generation. The second generation contains rechargeable battery: Magic Keyboard 2(MLA22LL) and Magic Mouse 2(MLA02LL)\n\nBlogging and Course Production\n\n\n\nGadget\nMy Usage\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nCanon EOS 700D\nI've noticed an iPhone 7 Plus just can't beat the depth that the DSLR camera offers. I use my camera to record all of my introduction and conclusion videos. It's affordable and great for those who want to get started and make videos.\nCamera\n\n\nBluetooth Selfie Stick\nInstead of extending my arm, I like to use it to show background and take pictures with my friends.\nCamera Tool\n\n\nToshiba 1TB Portable Hard Drive\nI can't store everything on my mac. So, this is just great even as a backup as well. If you are serious about making online courses or you have a lot images, it's just a must.\nStorage\n\n\nSamsung 64GB SD Card\nI used to record videos with a normal SD card but its writing speed was so slow that the recording stopped after a couple seconds. I had no issue with the SD card.\nStorage\n\n\nBlue Snowball USB Microphone\nAll of my YouTube tutorials and Udemy course videos are recorded with this microphone. I love it. Since I've lost its stand, I've been using a pizza box as you can see in my recent videos.\nMicrophone\n\n\nSony Camera Microphone\nI use it along with my camera since the Blue Snow Microphone is too big to carry it all the time.\nMicrophone\n\n\n\nProductive Home Office\nCurrently, I work at home and having the right work environment allows me to stay focused and spend less than on doing tasks that don't add much value to my production. Unlike the iOS Development Tools mentioned above, these are non-tech related gadgets that I crave.\n\n\n\nGadget\nWhy I Would Get\nCategory\n\n\n\n\n3-Piece Corner Desk\nI just need a long desk. I care about how things look because the environment influence my mind subconsciously. It's affordable as well.\nDesk\n\n\nLeather Chair\nSimilar to the phone stand and the desk, it just looks visually appealing. I tend to grab products that look good because I feel good.\nChair\n\n\niPhone Stand\nNot only it is visually aesthetic, but also it allows me to use my app instantly because I don't even need to grab, but just scroll with my finger comfortably.\nPhone Stand\n\n\nPhone Ring Stand\nI think it's just a must because it allows me to watch YouTube videos while eating food and right before I go to bed.\nStand\n\n\nSilver Laptop Stand\nIf I use a double monitor, it's essential for me to get a laptop stand  so that my next does not have to move up and down and stay align with the height of the monitor. It puts less stress. Also, the color matches with the laptop so it looks aesthetic.\nLaptop Stand\n\n\n\nWish List\n\n\n\nGadget\nWhy I wish\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nMacBook Pro 15.4-inch with Touch Bar\nI just want to take my laptop to the next level. I've been using my laptop but I just want it a little bit better so that I can render videos faster\nComputer\n\n\nSamsung 27-Inch Curved Monitor\nI have a descent monitor, but again, I've never had curved one before. So, I just want to try it out\nMonitor\n\n\nApple Airpods\nCurrently, I use Samsung's bluetooth earphone, but Airpods is just classy. I got hooked by Apple's video.\nHeadphones\n\n\nC Shape 4-in-1 Stabilizer\nAlthough I'm not a film maker, I'd love to watch one of these when I travel during summer breaks.\nCamera\n\n\n\n\nI'm going to buy these whenever I have a chance. These are just amazing.\n\nTravel\nI travel quite often because my family has been living in different parts of the world. Therefore, I always carry these products below so that I can stay productive even if I travel.\n\n\n\nTravel\nUsage\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nXiaomi 10000mAH\nI carry it everywhere because I blog and make tutorials with my phone. I also do a lot of social media and communication with my phone. It is indispensable.\nCharger\n\n\nTravel Universal Adapter Charger\nI hate wires and chargers because they take up a lot of space and wires cause massive headaches. But, the universal charger takes care of all the hassle for me\nCharger\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware \nHosting and Cloud Computing\n\n\n\nSaaS\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nDigital Ocean\nI use it to run virtual servers. It's more affordable than Google's\n\n\nBluehost\nI use it to host my website and purchase my domain name\n\n\n\nFinance\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nTransferWise\nIt disrupts the way banks send money. It's decentralized so the international wire transfer occurs within a day or two and it's cheap if you are dealing with money less than $10,000. Get started with sending £500 for free with the link\n\n\nQuickbooks\nIt creates invoice, track all my expenses, employee payrolls. It helps me prepare for my upcoming tax returns.\n\n\n\nSchedule & Events\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nCalendly\nThis is my favorite scheduling tool. You don't need to buy a premium account. It's free to use. It allows you to set date and time blocks when you are available, when you send your profile link to someone else, the person can choose the time based on their time zone. I use it all the time for scheduling. You can see my schedule here.  \n\n\nTito\nI've used Evenbrite to organize and schedule events. But, Tito provides a seamless experience for me. The landing page looks great. I recently purchased a ticket for the upcoming Swift conference.\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nGitbook\nI'm currently using Gitbook to document. It allows me to allow Markdown seamlessly with my favorite Text Editor and Github. If you want to get started, feel free to watch this tutorial. I also use it to share my lecture notes for The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\n\nTemplate\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nJupiter Wordpress Theme\nI recently bought this theme to create my own personal website without having to write a single line of code because it provides pre-made and highly customizable drag and drop elements. You can find out what you could possibly create this theme here.\n\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\nApps\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nInbox by Gmail\nI love using this app instead of relying on iPhone's default mail or Gmail. The app automatically organizes items into separate groups through machine learning, and I may archive or read the entire group with a single swipe. As a person who receives a number of comments on social media, this app is just perfect for me\n\n\nDiscord\nAlthough Slack is okay, I use Discord because it's free for unlimited users. It's loved by gamers since it provides channels for voice calls. But, it also provides syntax and markdown highlighting. In fact, I have a group for my students to interact with each other.\n\n\n\nFeedback and Survey\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nTypeform\nI used to use Google Form, but Type form looks a little more engaging because it provides interactive experience and you can also add payment\n\n\n\nVideo Editing\nAdobe Premier Pro and Aftereffect\nProject Management\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nWrike\nWrike is an ideal project management solution for teams and businesses of all sizes: from solopreneurs and small startups to Fortune 500 firms.\n\n\nTrello\nTrello provides an overview. I use it to organize my weekly work.\n\n\n\n \n \nBooks \nI read 80-100 books a year. Although I'm 20, books allow me to gain insights and allow me to process any situation.\nSoftware Development\nAlthough I spend a majority of time learning iOS, I also attempt to learn design patterns, interview questions, and algorithms so that I can stay on top of the game.\n\n\n\nBook\nAuthor\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nCracking the Code Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions\nGayle McDowell\nAlgorithm & Data Structure\n\n\niOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide\nChristian Keur\niOS Development\n\n\n\nStartup\nAlthough my first startup failed, I incorporated and grew the team with close to a dozen employees.

Do you know what completion handlers and how to design one for your project? Do you know retain cycle within closures and delegates? Do you know the difference between autoclosures, trailing closures, and escaping closures? Do you know every usage case of ? and ! intype casting and error handling? Do you know how to create custom operators. Do you truly understand the statement, \"Swift is a protocol oriented programming language\", and know how to use default protocols such as Equatable, Comparable, Sequence, and Iterator Protocol. Lastly, do you know the difference between normal and recursive enums?\nThese are just a few topics from the course. Yet, I already know many of you don't know these topics because I've conducted close to thousands of surveys (Social Proof, Screen). I know the iOS learning environment more than anyone else.\nHere is the problem. Most students lack fundamentals because many courses and books focus on the final products. You've probably heard or taken, \"Be a paid developer and build 21 apps just by taking one course.\" Give me a break. You know what happens. They end up being code monkeys, copying and pasting. I'm speaking from my experience and hundreds of personal emails.\n\nFocus: Social proof, Fear of missing out, Scarcity\n\nWhat Makes the Course Unique\nIn this course, you will learn the four major paradigms in Swift: Functional, Object Oriented, and Protocol Oriented, and lastly value oriented with structs and enums.\nHere are a list of weapons that distinguish this course from the rest.\n\nI focus on every detail. My default font is 28px. I also have a pointer and zooming effect so that you have no problem watching my course on your phone. (Screen)\nThe entire lecture note is available with source code, explanations, resources, and references. You may use the entire book a reference even when you take a shower since phones nowadays are water proof. (Screen)\nYou can see my face while learning although it takes more editing effort and preparation since I have to look presentable at all times. (Screen)\nMy lessons are prepared from top to bottom. There is no unexpected error and you won't waste time me trying to figure out what's going on. (Screen)\nLastly, you may join the group chat and ask questions at any time (Screen)\n\n\nFocus: Fear of missing out, Scarcity\n\nWhat the Students Will Do\nMaking a software is similar to writing a novel. You may still be able to publish your first ebook even if it is filled with wrong grammar and wrong words.\nYou may have questioned yourself whether you are writing decent lines of code. You may have felt embarrassed to show your code to someone else. Well, you've come to the right place. You've got to know every expression and find out pros and cons. I haven't seen single course that attempts what I try to accomplish. If you take the journey with me, you will come out coding in a different league.\nEvery lesson is filled with practical examples. After each lesson, you probably get an urge to fix your pre-existing code base. You don't learn something just for the sake of learning. You will and you must apply. This will only happen when you take this course with me.\n\nFocus:  Focus on possibility and hope.\n\nIdeal Students\nThis course is designed for anyone who has been programming with Swift or other similar languages such as Javascript and understand the basic concept of Object Oriented Programming, else-if and switch statement. If you've never programmed before, don't worry. I've attached  videos for you to catch up and join the course later when you are ready.\nCall to Action\niOS developers in Silicon Valley make 6 figures yet bootcamps are still expensive over $1,000 - $3000 depending on the region. This course is only $50. Let me put you in a perspective, let say you earn $3,000. But if you are able to code more effectively with fewer bugs and fast production speed by taking this course by 50%, the price you pay for this course is nothing compared what you will gain after.\nThere is be no discount unless you are a student from third world countries. If you are not satisfied with the material, of course, there is 30-day money back guaranteed.\nHere is the last statement. I'm 20 years old. I dropped out of college instead of  getting a degree to be a chemical engineer for my purpose. I dropped out to teach and provide global education. If you want to grow and learn together and provide great impact on the humanity, I will you there.\n\nFocus:  Commitment and Consistency, Anchorism,\n\n"},"course/introduction/course-overview.html":{"url":"course/introduction/course-overview.html","title":"Course Overview","keywords":"","body":"Course Overview\nWelcome to Learn Swift with Bob. You've made the right choice. You won't regret the decision to embark the journey with me.

From Chapter 1 to 4, you will get a firm understanding of both Intro to Functional, and protocol, and Object Oriented Programming. In Chapter 5, you will fully understand how objects are created and removed. In Chapter 6 and 7, you will learn how to create value oriented swift code along with protocol generics and enums. In the last Chapter, you will acquire various advanced and hidden tips and secrets about the Swift programming language.\nCourse Expectation\nBased on the Stack Overflow survey in 2016, Swift is considered as the second most loved language out of thousands. However, don't let its readability and hype fool you. It's a complex language inspired by many. Let us through the course expectation.\nBe Skeptical\nI’m a biased human being. I hope you do not trust me all the way. If you spot any practices that raise your eyebrows, make sure challenge me and come up with a better solution. Although I try to prevent that from happening through doing my homework, I encourage you to think outside of the box.\nBe Proactive\nYou might have seen those red error messages on the left side. I expect you to figure out and search what the issue is. Copy and paste the error message on Google. Ask me questions. Do whatever it takes. Do not move on without knowing the cause and how you could prevent them from occurring in the future.\nLearning Mentality\nLearning is done by you, not me. I’m here to teach you how to catch fish. I’m going to show you how to use nets and fish rods. After this course, you are expected to use those tools on your own. You might cut yourself through sharp edges, but it's just a part of your learning journey and becoming a stronger version of yourself.\nIdeal Learning Stage\nLet us through an ideal learning stage for the students.\n\n\n\nStep\nDetail\n\n\n\n\nThe Why\nEach lesson should flow like a story. In the beginning, I start off with a problem statement. It consists of doubts and questions I personally encountered. For example, I would ask, what's the purpose of using optionals? A problem statement organically leads to why we learn.\n\n\nApplication\nAfter having gone through the specific problem statement by showing new features and how to use them, I present how it applies to real-life situations.\n\n\nResources\nI attach additional resources for you to study more. You may go further on your own.\n\n\nVisualization\nIt's your turn. I don't believe in practice problems. We no longer live in a world where there are fixed answers. You visualize how the feature you've learned can be applicable for your future endeavor. Albert Einstein said, \"Imagination is more important than knowledge\". Practice problems turn you into a machine. We have more than enough by the current education system designed to reduce cost for testing.\n\n\nTest\nIt's time to put your visualization into practice.

You will also learn standard practices through generics, error handling and guard statement to create reusable, modular, and safe lines of code. Swift provides us with amazing tools to work with, such as optional chainings and extension. Let's utilize them as much as we can.\nI started my programming journey with Swift.

Let's begin our first step.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/optionals.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/optionals.html","title":"Optionals","keywords":"","body":"Optionals\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the first lesson of The Swift Fundamentals. When I first started programming in Swift, I took courses from Udemy, Treehouse, Lynda, and many more. Yet, I could not understand what those ? and ! stood for.  Xcode kept telling me what to do on the left side, causing more problems. It seemed like no instructor could explain the reasoning behind how to use optionals, and most importantly, why Swift engineers have implemented such feature that is so unique compared to other programming languages. Today, You will discover the why with me.\nProblem\nWhy did Swift engineers implement optionals?\nImplicit and Explicit Type\nRules\n\nEvery variable type must be defined (Implicit/Explicit)\nThe type is inferred based on the value\n\n// String\nlet name: String = \"Bob\"          // Explicit\nlet newName = \"Bob the Developer\" // Implicit\n\n// Numbers\nlet myAge: Int = 20               // Explicit\nlet mySisterAge = 14              // Implicit\nlet myGPA: Double = 3.54          // Explicit\n\n\nReasons for the rules above Google Slide\n\nFetching Profile Picture\nWhen you fetch a profile picture from Facebook, it may return no value, a.k.anil. However, you may not store nil to a normal type based on the rule above.\n// If could return \"URL\" or \"nothing\"\n\n// Successful\nlet myProfileImageURL: String = \"https//facebook.com/bobthedeveloper\"\n// Error\nlet myProfilePictureURL: String = nil\n\nIntroduction to Optionals\nOptionals allow storing nil, a.k.a absence of value.\nlet myName: String? = nil\nlet yourName: String? = \"Bob Lee\"\n\nprint(myName) // nil   \nprint(yourName) // Optional(\"Bob Lee\")\n\nlet bobAge: Int? = nil\nlet robAge: Int? = 123\nlet danAge: Int? = 3\n\nOptionals Rules\n\nOptionals/Normal Types do not interact with each other\nConvert Optionals to Normal Types for usage. The process is also known as unwrapping.\n\nrobAge + danAge\n// Error\n\nOptionals Unwrapping\nThere are two ways to convert/unwrap optional types to normal types\n\nForced unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping\n\nForced Unwrapping\n You may convert by inserting ! at the end of  the variable. Forced Unwrapping should be avoided since it causes a crash if the optional type contains nil since a normal type can't store nil.\nlet profileImageFromFacebook: String? = \"ImageURL...\"\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook) // Optional\n\nNow, let us unwrap profileImageFromFacebook.\nvar image = profileImageFromFacebook! // String? converted to String\nprint(image) // Normal Type\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook!) // Normal Type\n\nYou must unwrap to work with variables.  \nlet newRobAge = robAge!\nlet newDanAge = danAge!\n\nnewRobAge + newDanAge // Good\n\nBad things happen when you try to force unwrap an optional type whose value contains nil.\nvar image: String? = nil\nlet normalImage = image!  // let normalImage = nil\n// Error\n\n\nYou can't store nil to a normal type in Swift. It violates the Swift rule.\n\nImplicit Unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping is a safe way to convert. If the optional type contains nil, it does not break the system. Instead, it ignores. Implicit unwrapping is an added feature to an else-if statement.\nlet imageFromFaceBook: String? = \"Bob's Face\"\n\nif let normalImage = imageFromFaceBook {\n  print(normalImage)\n} else {\n  print(\"There is no image\")\n}\n\nNow normalImage contains a normal type of String. You may use the normalImage constant within the if block. On the contrary, if imageFromFaceBook contains nil, Swift executes the else block instead.\nSource Code\n1001_optionals.playground\nResources \n\n\nConclusion\nYou've learned two fundamental concepts in the Swift Programming Language. The rule number one states, every type, even if optionals, has to be defined explicitly or implicitly for safety. Second, there are two ways to unwrap optionals to normal types.  You may force unwrap with ! or safety unwrap with if-let.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn why ? and ! automatically appear when you create an object and access its properties and methods.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/optional-chaining.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/optional-chaining.html","title":"Optional Chainings","keywords":"","body":"Optionals Chainings\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of The Swift Fundamentals. In the previous lesson, you've learned why we use optionals and how to convert them to normal types.\nHowever, you might have wondered why ? and ! automatically appear when you access properties and methods of an object. If you haven't, that's okay. The goal is to prevent you from guessing. Let us find out what goes under the hood\nProblem\nWhy do I see ? and ! when accessing methods and properties?\nOptional Chaining in UIKit\nYou might have seen,  \nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel().highlightedTextColor?.cgColor\n\nThe mysterious ? appears all of a sudden. Let us attempt to replicate the phenomenon.\nDesign Human\nCreate a class, Human, which contains a String property, name and a method, sayHello().\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n\n  func sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello, I'm \\(name)\")\n  }\n}\n\nDesign Apartment\nCreate a class, Apartment, which contains a property whose type is Human?.\nclass Apartment {\n  var human: Human?\n}\n\nInitialize Property\nCreate an instance of Apartment and assign its human property.\nvar seoulApartment = Apartment()\nseoulApartment.human = Human(name: \"Bobby\")\n\nCall Property and Method\nNow, try to grab the human property of seoulApartment. Since the type of human is optional, ? gets added automatically.\n\nRules: When you access a property whose type is optional, Swift will add ?. Anything that comes after the ? will be optional.\n\n\nvar myName = seoulApartment.human?.name // Always return an `optional` type since human is `optional`.\n\nmyName is an optional type. Therefore, unwrapping is needed.\nif let name = myName {\n  print(name)\n}\nForce Unwrap\nYou may force unwrap while optional chaining. However, if the property is not initialized, it will crash.\nvar NYCApartment = Apartment()\nlet NYCResident = NYCApartment.human!.name // Error: No value for human\n\nSource Code\n1002_optional_chainings.playground\nResources\nMy Favorite Xcode Shortcuts Part 1, Part 2, Part 3\nConclusion\nYou've learned optional chaingins provide shortcuts to nested properties and methods among classes and structs. However, ? automatically appears when you access a property whose type is optional to indicate that anything that comes after may contain no value since the optional property may be nil.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn how to use a guard statement to implicitly unwrap multiple optionals instead of classic if let statements.\nAgain, if you wish to increase your coding productivity, feel free to check my articles posted.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/guard-defer-statement.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/guard-defer-statement.html","title":"Guard and Defer Statement","keywords":"","body":"Guard Statement\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 3 of The Swift Fundamentals. When I started learning Swift for the first time, an else-if statement made sense. However, a guard statement rather seemed daunting. In fact, the name doesn't tell anything about what it does. One day, however, I discovered something. A guard statement is just another for you to write an else-if statement. A guard statement promotes zenness. In other words, it adds clarity, emptiness, and lots of cloud and space. Let us find out through examples.\n\nZenness: A trait where peace, calmness, and inner awesomeness are all intertwined - Urban Dictionary\n\nProblem\n\nIs there any alternative way to write an else-if statement?\nHow do you safely unwrap multiple optionals?\n\nTypical Else-If\nWithout having known about guard, you have used a long else-if statement to indicate an error message block.\nfunc checkDrinkingAge() {\n  let canDrink = true\n\n  if canDrink {\n    print(\"You may enter\")\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n\n  } else {\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    print(\"Let me take you to the jail\")\n  }\n}\n\nIssues with Else-If\n\nNested brackets\nHave to read every line to spot the error message\n\nGuard Statement\nA guard block only runs if the condition is false, and it will exit out of the function through return. If the condition is true, Swift ignores the guard block. It provides an early exit and fewer brackets.\nfunc checkDrinkProgram() {\n  let iCanDrink = true\n\n  guard iCanDrink else {\n    // if iCanDrink == false, run this block\n    print(\"Let's me take you to the jail\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  print(\"You may drink\")\n  // You may move on\n  // Come on.\n  // You may leave\n  // You don't need to read this.\n  // Only one bracket on the bottom: feeling zen.\n}\n\nUnwrap Optionals with Else-If\nA guard statement is not only useful for replacing a typical conditional block with an else-if statement, but also great for unwrapping optionals by minimizing the number of brackets. To compare, let's first begin how to unwrap multiple optionals with else-if.\nFirst, let us create three optionals that will be unwrapped.\nvar publicName: String? = \"Bob Lee\"\nvar publicPhoto: String? = \"Bob's Face\"\nvar publicAge: Int? = nil\n\nThe Worst Nightmare\nYou never want to do this.\nfunc unwrapOneByOne() {\n  if let name = publicName {\n    if let photo = publicPhoto {\n      if let age = publicAge {\n        print(\"Bob: \\(name), \\(photo), \\(age)\")\n      } else {\n        print(\"age is mising\")\n      }\n    } else {\n      print(\"photo is missing\")\n    }\n  } else {\n    print(\"name is missing\")\n  }\n}\n\nThe code above certainly works but violates the DRY principle. It's atrocious. Let us break it down.\n\nDRY: Don't Repeat Yourself\n\nSlightly Better\nThe code below is more readable than above.\nfunc unwrapBetter() {\n  if let name = publicName {\n    print(\"Yes name\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No name\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  if let photo = publicPhoto {\n    print(\"Yes photo\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No photo\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  if let age = publicAge {\n    print(\"Yes age\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No age\")\n    return\n  }\n}\n\n\nWhen Swift encounters return, it stops and exits out of the function immediately\n\nUnwrap with Guard\nThe else-if statements can be replaced with guard.\nfunc unwrapOneByOneWithGuard() {\n  guard let name = publicName else {\n    print(\"Name missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  guard let photo = publicPhoto else {\n    print(\"Photo missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  guard let age = publicAge else {\n    print(\"Age missing\")\n    return\n  }\n  print(name)\n  print(photo)\n  print(age)\n}\n\nUnwrap Multiple Optionals with Else-If\nSo far, you've been unwrapping optionals one by one. Swift allows us to unwrap multiple optionals at once. If one of them contains nil, it will execute the else block.\nfunc unwrap() {\n  if let name = publicName, let photo = publicPhoto, let age = publicAge {\n    print(\"Your name is \\(name). I see your face right here, \\(photo), you are \\(age)\")\n  } else {\n    // if any one of those is missing\n    print(\"Something is missing\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: Be aware that when you unwrap multiple optionals at once, you can't identify which contains nil.\n\nUnwrap Multiple Optionals with Guard\nOf course, we should use guard over else-if.\nfunc unwrapWithGuard() {\n  guard let name = publicName, let photo = publicPhoto, let age = publicAge else {\n    // if one or two of the variables contain \"nil\"\n    print(\"Something is missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  print(\"Your name is \\(name). I see your, \\(photo). You are \\(age).\")\n  // Animation Logic\n  // Networking\n  // More Code, but still zen\n}\n\nDefer Statement\n\nDefer Statement: Put off (an action or event) to a later time; postpone.\n\nA defer block only executes only after current scope (loop, method, etc) exits.\nfunc simpleDefer() {\n  defer { print(\"Chill, later\")  }\n  print(\"Print First\")\n}\n\nLet us execute the simpleDefer() function.\nsimpleDefer()\n// \"Print First\"\n// \"Chill, later\"\n\nAnother example,\nfor i in 1...3 {\n  defer { print (\"Deferred \\(i)\") }\n  print (\"First \\(i)\")\n}\n\n// First 1\n// Deferred 1\n// First 2\n// Deferred 2\n// First 3\n// Deferred 3\n\nUsage Case for Defer\n\nExecuting completion handler blocks which you will learn in Chapter 3.  \nAny code you want to explicitly inform your team without requiring them to read the entire function\n\nSource Code\n1003_guard_defer_statement.playground\nConclusion\nIn this lesson, you've learned the power of guard over typical else-if.  First, it provides an early exit. Second, no one has to read the entire function to spot the error messages. You use a guard statement not just to please yourself, but for the sake of your teammates' falling hair when he/she reads your code. Keep guarding, everyone. Don't defer your learning, however.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/intro-error-handling.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/intro-error-handling.html","title":"Intro to Error Handling","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Error Handling\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 4, Intro to Error Handling, of The Swift Fundamentals. I feared Error Handling. I thought I had to be a professional debugger to fully utilize the feature. However, one day, I discovered, again. It's nothing more than writing an else-if block to send and deal with the error messages you've designed on your own. The built-in features of Error Handling since Swift 2.0 allow you to write cleaner, modular, and readable code.\nProblem\n\nHow do you warn your co-workers the function may result unexpected outcomes?\nWhat is a do-try block?\nHow do you distinguish between try?, try!, and try?\n\nDesign Safety Feature\nDesign a safety check for riders based on height. If the passenger is taller than 2m or below 1.4m, the program will send error messages along with other instructions.\nfunc checkHeight(height: Int) {\n  if height > 200 {\n    print(\"You are going to hit your head and fall off\")\n    // Take him/her off from the ride\n    // Code ...\n    // Seatbelt tighten\n\n  } else if height \nProblem with Else-If alone\n\nBloated function\nLack of modularity\nUncertainty\n\nError Handling\nError Handling is just additional way to write an else-if statement to not only deal with the error messages but also respond after them in a separate block.\nDesign Error\nCreate an enum that conforms to the Error protocol. Determine a few cases.  \nenum HeightError: Error {\n  case maxHeight\n  case minHeight\n}\n\n\nAny type that declares conformance to the Error protocol can be used to represent an error in Swift’s error handling system. Because the Error protocol has no requirements of its own, you can declare conformance on any custom type you create.\n\nDesign Throwable Function\nCreate a function that can throw/return errors by inserting throws at the end of the function parameter. The function does not contain error messages. Instead, it \"throws\" an error which will be \"caught\" and handled in a separate block with do-try.\nfunc checkHeightError(height: Int) throws {\n  if height > 200 {\n    throw HeightError.maxHeight\n  } else if height \nCall and Handle Error\nTo call a function that contains throws, the function requires try within a do block. A catch block is used to recognize and the error thrown by the function. If there is no error thrown, the catch block is ignored.\ndo {\n  try checkHeightError(height: 240)\n} catch HeightError.maxHeight {\n  print(\"Get out of here\")\n  // Logic\n} catch HeightError.minHeight {\n  print(\"Too short to ride\")\n}\n\nError Handling with Object Initialization\nDesign Error\nenum NameError: Error {\n  case noName\n}\n\nDesign Throwable Class\nWhen the user enters an empty string when initializing, the init method throws NameError.noName.\nclass Course {\n  var name: String\n\n  init(name: String) throws {\n    if name == \"\" {\n      throw NameError.noName\n    } else {\n      self.name = name\n      print(\"You've created an object!\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nInitialize and Handle Error\nCreate an object using try within a do-catch block.\ndo {\n  let myCourse = try Course(name: \"\")\n} catch NameError.noName {\n  print(\"Please make sure put something\")\n  // Logic\n}\n\nDistinguish Between try?, try!, and try\ntry is only used within a do-catch block.

You've learned a number of ! and ? since Lesson 1. These are language features that distinguish Swift from the rest, and you've got to know all, when, where, how, and, most importantly, why.\nIn this lesson, you learn how to convert types in objects that are created with classes and structs. In fact, if you use Storyboard in iOS, you must know type casting.\nProblem\n\nHow do you distinguish between as, as?, as!?\nWhy does Xcode keep telling me what to do?\n\nType Casting in UIKit\nYou might have seen,\nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel() as UIView\n\nYou've converted UILabel to UIView. UILabel is a subclass of UIView. Let us attempt to replicate the phenomenon with custom classes.\n The UIKit framework hierarchy\nHuman Class\nDesign a class called, Human that contains a single method.\nclass Human {\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi, I'm a human\")\n  }\n}\n\nHuman Subclass\nDesign Korean and Japanese which inherit from the Human class.\nclass Korean: Human {\n  func singGangNamStyle() {\n    print(\"Oppa Gangnam Style\")\n  }\n}\n\nclass Japanese: Human {\n  func doNinja() {\n    print(\"Shhh.....\")\n  }\n}\n\nCheck if all good\nlet bob = Korean()\nbob.introduce() // \"Hi, I'm a human\"\nbob.singGangNamStyle() // \"Oppa Gangnam Style\"\n\nType Casting\nYou may convert Korean to Human or vice versa. There are two ways: upcasting and downcasting.\nUpcasting\nUpcasting occurs when an object converts its type to the base class. In the early above, you've upcasted UILabel to UIView using as.\n\nThe word \"up\" aligns with the structure in the graph above.\n\nlet newBob = bob as Human  // Korean -> Human\nnewBob.introduce()\nnewBob.singGangNamStyle() // Does not exist\n\nUpcasting Example in Swift\nvar name = \"Bob\" as Any\nvar number = 20 as Any\nvar anyArray = [name, number] // [Any]\n\n\nI forgot to mention that Int and String are struct types which lack base classes. However, structs may only \"upcast\" to Any.\n\nDowncasting\nDowncasting is the opposite. You may downcast Any to String. However, it may fail since Any could contain many types. Analogous to optionals, there are two ways to downcast: Force downcasting or Implicit downcasting\nForce Downcasting\nIt does not return an optional type.  but if it fails, it crashes.\n// Force Downcasting\nlet newValue = anyArray[0] as! String\nlet newValue = anyArray[1] as! String // Error\n\n\nDowncasting is only available only after upcasting.\n\nImplicit Downcasting\n It returns an optional type. If it fails, it returns nil.\nlet newNewValue = anyArray[0] as? Int\nprint(newNewValue) // Optional(20)\n\nType Casting in Practice\nCreate Instances\nlet shion = Japanese()\nlet lee = Korean()\nlet kenji = Japanese()\nlet park = Korean()\n\nCreate Array Using Upcasting\n let humans: [Human] = [shion as Human, lee as Human, kenji as Human, park as Human]\n\nAutomatic upcasting\nlet humans: [Human] = [shion, lee, kenji, park]\nlet humans = [shion, lee, kenji, park]\n\nLoop\nfor human in humans {\n  if let korean = human as? Korean {\n    korean.singGangNamStyle()\n  }\n\n  if let japanese = human as? Japanese {\n    japanese.doNinja()\n  }\n}\n\nUsage in iOS Development\nTypecasting can be used to group UI Components and add attributes as a whole.\nimport UIKit\n\nlet loginButton = UIButton()\nlet loginMessage = UILabel()\nlet loginView = UIView()\n\nlet UIComponents = [loginButton, loginMessage, loginView]\n\nfor component in UIComponents {\n  if let button = component as? UIButton {\n    // Change background color\n    // Add Title\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  if let label = component as? UILabel {}\n  if let view = component as? UIView {}\n}\n\n\nImportant: Upcasting is not a recommended practice since there is a better way to go about: Protocol Oriented Programming. I mention drawbacks of using type casting through comparison in Chapter 3 and 5.\n\nAnother Example\nTo fetch a view controller from Storyboard, downcast to identify the designated view controller.\nlet storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil)\nlet vc = storyboard instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"VC\")\n// type of vc = UIViewController\nlet vc = storyboard instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"VC\") as! VC\n// type of vc = VC\n\nSource Code\n1005_type_casting.playground\nReference\nAnyObject and Any in Swift (Stack Overflow)\nConclusion\nI lied. I said type casting allowed to convert types in classes. However, you may also convert Int and String to Any even though they are made up of structs, not classes.\nUnnecessary type casting is not recommended among iOS developers because it causes a massive headache from casting back and forth. There is an alternative to go about. You will learn how to group objects together through Protocol Oriented Swift in Chapter 3. I know you are excited. Learn fast, but stay patient and consistent.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn how to design reusable code through generics. You will come out dry, not wet, a.k.a we enjoy typing.  \n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/generics.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/generics.html","title":"Intro to Generics","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Generics\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 6 of The Swift Fundamentals with Bob. When you think of the word, \"generic\", what makes you think? Well, I'm sure you've thought of versatile code. What? Don't you dare worry. I will walk you through. Remember, the number one goal is to write as little as possible, but produce as much.\nProblem\nI smell something.\n\nFor the reference, read more about code smell\n\nAccess Elements\nLet us reflect on how we rolled in the past.\nlet highSchoolGPA = [2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.8, 3.5]\nlet favoritePeople = [\"Elon Musk\", \"Steve Jobs\", \"Kevin O'leary\"]\nlet favoriteNumbers = [3, 20]\n\nThe Worst way to access elements\nhighSchoolGPA[0]\nhighSchoolGPA[1]\nhighSchoolGPA[2]\n\nLoop and Print\nThis is slightly better.\nfunc printDoubleElement(array: [Double]) {\n  for GPA in array {\n    print(GPA)\n  }\n}\n\nfunc printStringElement(array: [String]) {\n  for person in array {\n    print(\"I love \\(person)\")\n  }\n}\n\nfunc printNumberElement(array: [Int]) {\n  for number in array {\n    print(\"I like \\(number)\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nNeedlessly many functions. It goes against the DRY principle.\n\nIntroducing Generics\nA generic function allows you to pass any value regardless of types.   \nfunc genericFunction(value: anything) {\n  print(value)\n}\n\nfunc genericFunctions(value: WHATEVER) {\n  print(value)\n}\n\nSwift infers the type of anything or WHATEVER based on the input.\ngenericFunction(value: \"Bob\")  // anything is String\ngenericFunctions(value: true)    // WHATVER is Bool\n\nGeneric Loop\nLet us create a generic function.\nfunc printElement(array: [T]) {\n  for element in array {\n    print(element)\n  }\n}\n\nCall the function\nprintElement(array: highSchoolGPA) // 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, ...\nprintElement(array: favoritePeople) // 'Elon Musk\", \"Steve Jobs\", ...\n\n\nGeneric code enables you to write flexible, reusable functions, classes, enums, protocols, and structs subject to requirements that you define.\n\nNow only you can create generic functions, but also generic classes and structs. Let us begin with a non-generic struct.\nNon-Generic Struct\nCreate a Family struct that contains members whose type is [String]. Add a method that appends to the array.\nstruct Family {\n  var members = [String]()\n\n  mutating func push(member: String) {\n    members.append(member)\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The mutating keyword is added to function of enum and struct that mutates its own property/properties.\n\nNon-Generic Instance\nvar myFam = Family()\nmyFam.push(member: \"Bob\")\nmyFam.members // [\"Bob\"]\n\nThe struct above only works with String. Some families may have names in Int. Then, you must create a new struct. It goes against the DRY principle.\nGeneric Struct\nstruct genericFam {\n  var members = [T]()\n\n  mutating func push(member: T) {\n    members.append(member)\n  }\n}\n\nInstead of using WHATEVER or anything, T is a standard among iOS developers.\nDefine Type Explicitly\nNow, let us create an object from the generic struct. You have to specify the type based on the rule in Lesson 1.\nvar myGenericFamily = genericFam()\nmyGenericFamily.push(member: \"Bobby\")\n\nvar genericFamily = genericFam()\ngenericFamily.push(member: 123)\n\nDefine Type Implicitly\nHowever, the type can be inferred based on the input.\nlet myHappyFamily = genericFam(members: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  // T becomes Int\n\nGeneric Extension\nYou may add an extension to generics for more features. Let us grab the first element in the members property.\nextension genericFam {\n  var firstElement: T? {\n    if members.isEmpty {\n      return nil\n    } else {\n      return members[0]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet geekFamilyMember = genericFam(members: [\"Bob\", \"Bobby\"])\nlet firstElement = geekFamilyMember.firstElement // \"Bob\"\n\nType Constraints \nSo far, you could enter any value to define T. But, you may restricts the type you only want to interact with.\nFirst, design two classes.\nclass LOL {}\nclass BabyLol: LOL {}\n\nNow, let's create a function that only allows you to enter LOL.\nfunc addLOLClassOnly(array: [T]) { }\n\nWhen you run the addLOLClassOnly function, you can't add anything besides whose type is LOL.\naddLOLClassOnly(array: [LOL(), LOL(), LOL(), BabyLol()])\naddLOLClassOnly(array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) // Error\n\n\nImportant: BabyLol() has been automatically upcasted to LOL.\n\nResources\nIntro to Generics in Swift with Bob\nSource Code\n1006_generics.playground\nConclusion\nYou now understand how to maintain yourself dry through generic functions and structs. In later chapters, you will more about advanced generics along with enums and protocols.

There are two objectives. First, you will learn the fundamental difference between structs and classes by understanding value types and reference types. Second, you will discover why structs do not provide inheritance.\nProblem\n\nWhat are the differences besides inheritance?\nWhen to use structs over classes?\n\nDesign Class\nTo demonstrate the difference between classes and structs, first design a class, HumanClass that has a name property.\nclass HumanClass {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Instance\nvar humanClassObject = HumanClass(name: \"Bob\")\nhumanClassObject.name // \"Bob\"\n\nCreate another instance that \"copies\" humanClassObject\nlet newHumanClassObject = humanClassObject\n\nChange the name property of newHumanClassObject to \"Bobby\".\nhumanClassObject.name = \"Bobby\"\nnewHumanClassObject.name // \"Bobby\"\n\nThe name property of newHumanClassObject has been changed to \"Bobby\" as well.\nDesign Struct\nLet us find out if the same behavior occurs with an object created with structs\nstruct HumanStruct {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Instance\nCreate another instance that \"copies\" structObject\nvar structObject = HumanStruct(name: \"Bob\")\nlet newStructObject = structObject\n\nChange the name property of structObject to \"Bobby\".\nstructObject.name = \"Bobby\"\nnewStructObject.name // \"Bob\"\n\nOn the contrary, the change on the name property of structObject has no effect on newStructObject.name.\n The graph below shows the fundamental difference between value types vs reference types.\n The difference in value type and reference type\nClasses\nFor classes, when you create an instance that \"copies\", the new instance shares the object with the original instance.\nlet newHumanClassObject = humanClassObject // share\n\nStructs\nFor structs, when you create an instance that \"copies\", the new instance creates an identical copy of the object, and the object is not shared.\nlet newStructObject = structObject // copy-paste\n\nMutability\nDue to the fundamental difference, there is an interesting discrepancy when it comes to creating instances with let.\nMutability in Classes\nLet us create an instance with let and attempt to mutate its property.\nclass BobClass {\n  var name = \"Bob\"\n}\n\n// Create Instance\nlet bobClass = BobClass()\nbobClass.name = \"Bobby\"\n\nlet newBobClass = bobClass\n\nnewBobClass.name = \"Bob the Developer\"\nbobClass.name // \"Bob the Developer\"\n\nAlthough the instance, bobClass has been created with let, the property of it has been mutated.

Instances with classes have references to the object while withstructs store. As a result, classes are called reference types while structs and enums, are value types.\n At this point, you may find no incentive to learn the difference. You are right. For small apps, it doesn't matter. But, once you start implementing closures and delegates, and other reference related tasks,  you would soon discover a little more complexity which you will learn how to solve in Chapter 5. You will appreciate value types along with Protocol Oriented Programming soon.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/set-tuple.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/set-tuple.html","title":"Set and Tuple","keywords":"","body":"Set and Tuple\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 9 of The Swift Fundamentals. There are two objects. The first is to learn how to group a list of items with sets. The second is to work with various types within a single variable/constant with tuples.\nProblem\n\nI'd love to eliminate duplicated items: sets\nI'd love to combine all kinds of types: tuples\n\nIntroducing Sets\nA set stores values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering and no duplicated elements.\nMultiple Ways to Create Arrays\nBefore we create sets in Swift, let's review multiple ways to create an array.\n\nRemember, Array is just a generic struct.\n\nvar arrayOne: [Double] = [] // Most Common\nvar arrayTwo = [Double]()\n\nvar arrayThree: Array = []\nvar arrayFour: Array = Array()\nvar arrayFive = Array([1123.08, 234.23])\n\nvar arraySix = Array(1...100)\nvar arraySeven = Array(repeatElement(\"Bob\", count: 10))\n\n\nRemember, Set is just a generic struct.\n\nMultiple Ways to Create Sets\nSet in Swift looks similar to Array.\nvar setOne: Set = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar setTwo: Set = [\"Bob\", \"Bobby\", \"Bob the Developer\"]\nvar emptySet = Set()\n\nBuilt-In Set Methods\nSimilar to Array, Set contains default methods and properties.\nemptySet.insert(\"Bob\")\nemptySet.contains(\"Bob\") // true\nemptySet.remove(\"Bob\")\n\nCreate Two Arrays\nYou may convert Array to Set, or vice versa. In this example, let us convert Array to Set. First, create two arrays filled with odd and even numbers.\nvar oddNumbers: [Int] = []\nvar evenNumbers: [Int] = []\n\nfor number in 1...50 {\n  if number % 2 == 0 {\n    evenNumbers.append(number)\n  } else {\n    oddNumbers.append(number)\n  }\n}\n\nTertiary Operator\nYou may use tertiary operator as an alternative to achieve the same result above. You will learn more in 1011_intro_operators  \nfor number in 1...50 {\n  (number % 2 == 0) ? evenNumber.append(number) : oddNumber.append(number)\n}\n\nCheck\noddNumbers // [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...]\nevenNumbers // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...]\n\nConvert Array to Set\nvar oddNumberSet = Set(oddNumbers)\nlet evenNumberSet = Set(evenNumbers)\n\noddNumberSet and evenNumberSet no longer has defined order.\nBuilt-In Set Methods\nSet provides methods to work with multiple sets.\n Built-in Set methods\nUnion\noddNumberSet.union(evenNumberSet)\n\nSymmetric Difference\noddNumberSet.symmetricDifference(evenNumberSet)\n\nIntersection\noddNumberSet.intersection(evenNumberSet)\n\nSubtract\noddNumberSet.subtract(evenNumberSet)\n\nvar numberSet = Set([1, 2, 3])\nlet secondNumberSet = Set([1, 2])\n\nnumberSet.subtract(secondNumberSet)\nprint(numberSet) // {3}\n\nSubtract mutates oddNumberSet. Therefore, the oddNumberSet instance must be var rather than let. You can predict whether a method is mutating or not based on the naming guide below.\nSwift Naming Guide\n\n\n\nMutating\nNon-Mutating\n\n\n\n\nverb\nadjective\n\n\narray.append()\narray.sorted()\n\n\narray.sort()\narray.appending\n\n\n\nSort\nSince sets do not provide any order, sets must be converted to an array type to be sorted. There is a built-in method called, sorted().\nlet sortedArray = evenNumberSet.sorted()\nprint(sortedArray) // [2, 4, 6, ...]\n\nFunctional Programming\nThe sorted() is flexible.\nlet sortedArrayFromHighToLow = evenNumberSet.sorted { $0 > $1 }\nprint(sortedArrayFromHighToLow) // [100, 98, 96, ...]\n\nIn this course, you are not going to learn how sorted() is constructed. However, if you are interested in learning more about Functional Programming with MVVM, you can be on the mailing list for my upcoming courses.\nPractical Usage of Set\n\nFinding unique letters and unique visitors\nAny game logic (Up to your imagination)\n\nIntroducing Tuples\nYou may combine multiple types of value in a single let or var.\nlet firstScore = (name: \"Bob\", score: 9)\n\nYou may access elements through calling the index similar to Array\nfirstScore.0 // \"Bob\"\nfirstScore.1 // 9\n\nYou may also access the elements through the labels.\nfirstScore.name // \"Bob\"\nfirstScore.score // 9\n\nHowever, you don't have to specify the argument labels.\nlet secondScore = (\"Rob\", 10)\nsecondScore.0\nsecondScore.1\n\nPractical Usage\nThis is your past.\nlet httpFailure: [Any] = [401, \"Fail\"]\n\nYou no longer have to upcast to Any.\nlet httpSuccess = (code: 200, description: \"success\")\nhttpSuccess.code\n\nBonus Tips\nYou created multiple instances in a single line.\n// Okay\nvar dog = \"dog\", cat = \"cat\"\nprint(dog)\n\nInstead, you may use tuple\n// Better\nvar (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3)\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\n\nYou may convert an array into a tuple that contains index and element through the enumerated() method.\nvar shoppingList = [\"Eggs\", \"Milk\", \"Rice\"]\n\nfor (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {\n  print(index, value)\n}\n\nSource Code\n1009_set_tuple.playground\nReference\nSwift API Design Guidelines\nConclusion\nTo recap, Set is used to group non-duplicate items with no order. Tuple is used to group all kinds of types with the order you define.  Second, you've learned how to identify mutating vs non-mutating methods based on the naming guide. Make sure you follow the same principle in your codebase as well. Don't get too caught up with Functional Programming. I know it sounds cool.

Object Oriented Programming is at the heart of the iOS ecosystem. We, developers, have no choice but to follow the platform created by Apple engineers. Therefore, one must know well about Object Oriented Programming.\nThe primary focus of this chapter is to understand how the platform utilizes OOP to produce modular code base. You will learn fundamentals principles such as singleton, type property, and convenience init to step your game. I've designed this chapter to be practical so that you may start using what you've learned in each lessons right in your current projects.\nWe will continue to focus on producing dry and quality code so that no longer feel a lack of confidence when you were asked to reveal your code.

You will learn how to become lazy.  In other words, you become smarter and effective when it comes to initializing an object. In programming, getting lazy to write less code is in fact good for your teammates and users as long as it's readable and gets the job done. Bill Gates once mentioned, whenever there is hard work to be done, he assigns it to the laziest person as he or she is sure to find an easy way of doing it.\nProblem\nI'm lazy. Can we initialize quickly?\nCreate Class with Designated Init\nCreate a class called Human\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n }\n\n  // Convenience init intializes the designated init method\n  convenience init() {\n    self.init(name: \"Bob Lee\")\n  }\n}\n\nConvenience init initializes the designated init method by calling self.init.\nCreate Object\nlet lee = Human(name: \"Bob Lee\") // init(name: String)\nlet bob = Human() // Convenience init()\n\nInitialize UIColor\nCreate an instance that stores UIColor.\nimport UIKit\n\nlet randomColor = UIColor(colorLiteralRed: 255/255, green: 80/255, blue: 85/255, alpha: 1)\n\nCustom Convenience Init\nCreate our own convenience init that initializes the designated init by adding extension to UIColor.\nextension UIColor {\n convenience init(r: Float, g: Float, b: Float) {\n   self.init(colorLiteralRed: r/255, green: g/255, blue: b/255, alpha: 1)\n }\n}\n\nlet myFavoriteColor = UIColor(r: 255, g: 80, b: 85)\n\nApplication\n\nQuick initialization for open source projects\nCustom convenience inits with UIKit\n\nSource Code\n2001_convenience_init.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to become lazy and effective at the same time. Imagine, you are the owner of a library for your teammates. They no longer have to use the bloated designated init method. Instead, you may provide multiple convenience init methods so that their lives become easier. It is similar to how the Apple engineers have provided us with convenience init methods for UIColor. It's a win-win situation.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn how to fail initializations.\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/computed-property.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/computed-property.html","title":"Computed Property","keywords":"","body":"Computed Property\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of Object Oriented Swift. You will learn how to create relationships between variables. You no longer have to manage two or more variables separately. You probably have seen get and set before. If you haven't, don't you worry. I will walk you through by placing your feet on mine.\nProblem\nDo we have to make functions all the time to calculate something?\nAtrocious Code\nUnrelated functions that take up many lines. The functions below are used to calculate a radius and diameter.\nfunc getDiameter(radius: Double) -> Double {\n return radius * 2\n}\nfunc getRadius(diameter: Double) -> Double {\n return diameter / 2\n}\n\ngetDiameter(radius: 10) // return 20\ngetRadius(diameter: 200) // return 100\ngetRadius(diameter: 600) // return 300\n\nThe two functions are separate and there is no relationship . Computed Property will help you solve this problem.\nIntroducing Computed Property\nYou may create a variable that only can be read. It is also referred to as a gettable property.\n\nComputed = calculated\n\nGettable Property\nCreate a only readable property.\nclass NumberClass {\n  var readableNumber: Double {\n    get {\n      // Complex logic\n      return 777\n    }\n  }\n  var readableNumbers: Double {\n    return 789\n  }\n}\n\nIf you attempt to modify the property, it will give you an error.\nreadableNumber = 10 // Error\nreadableNumbers = 20 // Error\n\nGettable and Settable Property\nYou may not only make a property gettable, but also settable by inserting set right after get.  Let us create a relationship between radius and diameter.\nvar radius: Double = 10\nvar diameter: Double {\n  get {\n    return radius * 2\n  }\n  set {\n    radius = newValue / 2\n  }  \n}\n\nnewValue refers to the newly set value of diameter.  For example, when you set diameter to 100,  newValue becomes 100.\ndiameter = 50\nradius = 100\ndiameter // 200\n\nInstead of calling newValue, you may add a different name. In the example below, there is a relationship between area and side. Instead of calling newValue, let us use newArea.\nimport Foundation\n\nvar side: Double = 100\nvar area: Double {\n get {\n   return side * side\n }\n set(newArea) {\n   side = sqrt(newArea)\n }\n}\n\nThere is a relationship between side and area.\narea = 1000\nside // 31.6\n\nApplications\n\nGrabbing and storing data the server\nPropagating relationships between properties\nPreventing others from manipulating your code\n\nSource Code\n2002_computed_property.playground\nConclusion\n You've learned what it means to create a gettable property that can be only read. You've also learned how to create a settable property which allows you to modify its value as well as those of others. The UIKIt framework often utilizes gettable properties to prevent us, developers, from modifying them. \nIn the lesson lesson, you will learn how to add an observer to a property.\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/property-observers.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/property-observers.html","title":"Property Observers","keywords":"","body":"Property Observer\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 3 of Object Oriented Swift. You are going to learn how to add an observer to a property so that you may track when it is mutated or anything happens.\nProblem\nHow can I add observer/tracker to a property?\nwillSet and didSet\n\nwillSet is called just before the value is set\ndidSet is called immediately after the new value is set to the property.\n\nGrade Tracker\nvar myGrade: Int = 80 {\n  willSet(newGrade) {\n    print(\"About to change your grade to \\(newGrade)\")\n  }\n  didSet {\n    print(\"Your grade has been changed\")\n    print(\"you had \\(oldValue) previously.

Now you have 100\"\n\nThe willSet block is called before myGrade is set to 100. The didSet block runs only after. oldValue refers to the initial value.\nStep Counter\nCreate a variable called, totalSteps. When the variable encounters a new value, you may notify the user that the value has been changed.\nvar totalSteps: Int = 20 {\n  willSet(newTotalSteps) {\n    print(\"About to set totalSteps to \\(newTotalSteps)\")\n  }\n  didSet {\n    if totalSteps > oldValue  {\n      print(\"Added \\(totalSteps - oldValue) steps\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ntotalSteps = 60\n// \"About to set totalSteps to 60\"\n// \"Added 20 steps\"\n\nApplication\nYou may notify the user or change background color once the user successfully logs in to the app.\nvar userLoginInfo: Bool = false {\n  willSet(newValue) {\n    print(\"The user has tried something\")\n  }\n  didSet {\n    if userLoginInfo {\n      print(\"The user has switched from \\(oldValue) to \\(userLoginInfo)\")\n      // Backgroud color\n      // Animation\n      // Pop Up\n      // All kinds of stuff\n  }\n }\n}\n\nuserLoginInfo = true\n// The user has tried something\n// The user has switched from false to true\nuserLoginInfo = true\n// The user has tried something\n// The user has switched from true to true\n\nSimilarity with Computed Property\n\nAlways recalculated even if the value has not changed.\n\nWhat makes Property Observers different\n\nThere is a default value and it is observed rather than calculated.\nwillSet and didSet will not get called when you initialize it.\n\nSource Code\n2003_property_observers.playground\nConclusion\nThe purpose of using property observers is not only to write less code but also to provide greater readability through the distinctive keywords.

As we've discussed many times, anything that has to do with ? in the Swift Programming Language will give you an optional value. Second, you reviewed the Swift error handling approach. Remember, the throw keyword is not only used within an else-if or guard block, but also within an init method.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to override everything while subclassing.\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/override-init-method-property.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/override-init-method-property.html","title":"Override Everything","keywords":"","body":"Override Everything\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 5 of Object Oriented Swift.

You may customize inherited properties and methods by inserting override.  You may access inherited properties and methods by calling super.\nclass ToyCar: Vehicle {\n  override var description: String {\n    return \"\\(super.description) hey, I'm a cute car\"\n  }\n\n  override func warning() {\n    print(\"hello, don't mind me\")\n    super.warning()\n  }\n}\n\nNow, let us access the description property and the warning method of ToyCar.\nlet myFutureCar = ToyCar()\nmyFutureCar.description\n// \"Hello, I'm moving at 30km/hr hey I'm a cute car\"\nmyFutureCar.warning()\n// \"hello, don't mind me\"\n// \"Be careful, I'm going pretty fast\"\n\nSuper Init\nYou may override an init method from the super class. Remember, every property must be initialized even the ones from the super class.\nDesign Super Class\nCreate a class that contain a property called, origin.\nclass Human {\n var origin: String\n\n init(enterOrgin: String) {\n   origin = enterOrgin\n }\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\nCreate a subclass, called Korean that inherits from Human. The Korean class contains a property called, name.  However, when you initialize, you must initialize the origin property from the Human class by calling super.init.\nclass Korean: Human {\n  let city: String\n\n  init(enterCity: String) {\n    self.city = enterCity\n    super.init(enterOrgin: \"Korean\")\n  }\n\n  init(enterCity: String, origin: String) {\n    self.city = enterCity\n    super.init(enterOrgin: origin)\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Object\nThere are two init methods in the Korean class. You may choose any since both initialize the origin property from the Human class.\nlet bob = Korean(enterName: \"Bob the Dev\")\nlet bobby = Korean(enterName: \"Bob the Dev\", myOrigin: \"Korean\")\n\nOverride Init\nNot only you may override methods and properties, but also init methods.\nDesign Base Class\nDesign a class called, Tesla.

You are going to learn one of the most useful, yet confusing topics.\nProblem\n I'm confused by static, final, class. What are those?\nStatic Property and Method\nNo longer have to initialize an object to access properties and methods. Let us design a struct that contains a type property and a type method.\nDesign Struct\nstruct SomeStructure {\n  static var storedTypeProperty = \"Some value.\"\n  static var computedProperty: Int {\n    get {\n      return 120\n    }\n    set {\n      print(\"You've set to \\(newValue)\")\n    }\n  }\n  static func hello() {\n    print(\"hello\")\n  }\n}\n\nAccess the properties and methods\nSomeStructure.storedTypeProperty // \"Some Value\"\nSomeStructure.hello() // 'hello\"'\n\n\nAnything that has static in front will not be overridden.\n\nClass\nUnlike static, class is only used within Classes. On the other hand, classes also support static.\n\nUnlike static, class properties may be overridden.\n\nDesign Class\nCreate a class called GrandParent.\nclass GrandParent {\n  static var numberOfYearsInMarriage = 30\n  static func introduce() {\n    print(\"We've been married for \\(numberOfYearsInMarriage)\")\n }\n\n  class func introducing() {\n    print(\"We've been married for \\(numberOfYearsInMarriage)\")\n  }\n\n  final func cantOverride() {\n    print(\"you can't change me\")\n  }\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\nNow, create Parent class that inherits GrandParent.

It has a static property with an object of the class itself.\nclass AccountManager {\n  static let sharedInstance = AccountManager()\n\n  var userInfo = (ID: \"bobthedev\", Password: 01036343984)\n\n  // Networking: communicating server\n  func network() {\n    // get everything\n  }\n\n  private init() { }\n}\n\n\nThe private  prevents initialization outside of the AccountManager class. If you wish to learn more, you may read The Complete Understanding of Access Control in Swift\n\nAccess Object\nAccountManager.sharedInstance.userInfo\n// (ID \"bobthedev\", Password 01036343984)\n\n// ViewController One\nAccountManager.sharedInstance.userInfo.ID // \"bobthedev\"\n\n// ViewController Two\nAccountManager.sharedInstance.userInfo.ID = \"bobleesj\"\n\n// ViewController Three\nAccountManager.sharedInstance.userInfo.ID // \"bobleesj'\n\nIn each view controller, you have access to only one AccountManager().\nExamples\nThe iOS ecosystem often use the singleton pattern for developers to access the universal object. A few examples include, UIApplication, UserDefault, NSNotification. If you wish to learn more about these classes, you may sign up for the upcoming course: The UIKit Fundamentals with Bob.\nSource Code\n2008_singleton_pattern.playground\nResources\nThe Complete Understanding of Access Control in Swift 3\nConclusion\nYou've learned the definition of Singleton. Again, think of me. There is only one Bob the Developer.\nOften developers avoid the singleton pattern at all cost. It exists everywhere, and when you have a number of them, it becomes difficult to track. So, I'd recommend not to overuse the pattern.

I took courses from Udemy, Lynda, Treehouse, and YouTube. However, there wasn't a single course that the instructor challenged herself to explain closures despite wide usage. As a result, including myself, students often turn into code monkeys. They simply copy off from the screen and Stack Overflow answers.\nFirst, let me ask you a question. Have you heard about completion handlers. If you had any experience with networking with database, such as Facebook Login, you have. But, do you know how to design one? Do you know how to initialize objects using closures? Do you know the difference between escaping and autoclosures? Do you know what it means to capture self?\nWhen I learned Swift as my first programming language, I had a touch time understanding closures. As I've been blogging for a while, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine.  It took me 3 months to completely understand closures. I don't expect you to be comfortable with closures just by taking a couple lessons with me. However, your time to mastery will dramatically decrease because you are here with me.\nAs much as I want to this chapter to be digestible, I have to admit it. It is not easy. The process is analogous to riding a bicycle for the first time. Your parents might be able to give you a little push from the back. At the end of the day, you are the one paddling and succeeding. Expect you will fall from the bicycle many times. Those mental scars, however, will define who you are because many give up.\nThroughout the chapter, I've attached a number of articles for you to study more. If you get stuck, you may refer to them and study until you get it. Do whatever it takes.  \n"},"course/functional-swift/intro-closure-part1.html":{"url":"course/functional-swift/intro-closure-part1.html","title":"Intro to Closures Part 1","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Closures Part 1\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson of 1 of Intro to Functional Swift. You will learn what makes closures different from the Swift functions. If you've never used closures before, this lesson will be tough.\nProblem\nWho are you closures, () -> ()?\nDefinition\n\nA closure is a function without name and the func keyword (for now).\nQuick and easy to carry around as a variable/constant or pass as a parameter\n\nFunctions\nTo appreciate closures, let us begin with functions. Create a function that add two numbers.\nfunc addTwoNumbers(number1: Int, number2: Int) -> Int {\n  return number1 + number2\n}\n\nFirst Class Citizen\nYou may store a function into a variable/constant.\nvar addFunction = addTwoNumbers\naddFunction(10, 30) // 40\n\nIntroducing Closures\nCreate a closure whose functionality is identical as above. A closure block begins and ends with {,}.\nvar addClosures: (Int, Int) -> Int = {\n  (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  return number1 + number2\n}\n\naddClosures(4, 10) // 14\n\nThe type of  addClosures is (Int, Int) -> Int. It is identical to addTwoNumbers from the early example. number1 and number2 are the parameter labels. Anything comes after  the keyword,in, is a return block.\nShort Form\nIt is not required to enter return after in only if the closure solely returns value.\nvar addClosuresTwo = {\n  (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  print(\"Hello\")\n  return number1 + number2 // return required\n}\n\nvar addClosuresThree = {\n  (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  number1 + number2 // return not required\n}\n\naddClosuresThree(4, 6)\n\nThe addClosuresTwo requires return since there is an additional line of print(\"Hello\"). Besides, you may skip the return keyword.\nShortest Form\nAs long as you specify the type, you may not create an argument label.\nvar addClosuresFour: (Int, Int) -> Int = { $0 + $1 }\naddClosuresFour(4, 5) // 9\n\nIn the example above, $0 and $1 refer to the first and second parameter.    Swift recognizes 4 as $0 and 5, $1 from addClosuresFour(4, 5).\nAnother Example\nLet us create a function that does not require any parameter but returns String.\nfunc callString() -> String {\n  return \"hello, I'm a function\"\n}\n\nLet us express the callString function with a closure block instead.\nlet callStringWtihClosure: () -> String = { () in\n  print(\"hello\")\n  return \"hello, I'm a closure\"\n}\n\ncallStringWtihClosure()\n// \"hello, I'm a closure\"\n\n// Skip Return\nlet callStringWtihClosureTwo: () -> String = { () in\n  \"hello, I'm a closure\"\n}\n\nShort Form \nIf you pass no parameter, you may ignore explicit type definition.\n// Type defined explicitly\nlet callStringWtihClosureThree: () -> String = { \"hello, I'm a closure\" }\n\n// Type defined implicitly\nlet callStringWtihClosureFour = { \"hello, I'm a closure\" }\ncallStringWtihClosureFour // () -> String\n\nResource\nNo Fear Closure in Swift 3 with Bob\nSource Code\n3001_intro_closures_part1.playground\nConclusion\nTo recap, you've learned functions and closures are identical. However, you may express closures using various forms which often lead to zenness and effective communication. You've learned the basics. You will discover the power of closures as you step up one at a time.\nYou may feel uncomfortable. You should be. In fact, if you are not struggling, you are not learning. Accumulating knowledge goes against the Second Law of Thermodynamics that the universe wants to remain scattered. When you defy the law as a human being, you face consequences. Embrace the pain and it's a natural phenomenon.\nIn the following lesson, you will how learn how to pass and return a closure block within a function.\n"},"course/functional-swift/intro-closure-part2.html":{"url":"course/functional-swift/intro-closure-part2.html","title":"Intro to Closures Part 2","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Closures Part 2\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of Intro to Functional Swift.

You may\n\nstore in a variable/constant\npass as a parameter\nreturn\n\n\nDisclosure: The Swift Function is called Global Closure\n\nReturn Closure\nLet us create a function that returns a closure block. There are two ways.\nReturn Closure Indirectly\nFirst, design a function whose return type is (Int, Int) -> Int.\nfunc returnClosure() -> ((Int, Int) -> Int) {\n  return addWithClosures\n}\n\nlet addClosure = returnClosure()\naddClosure(4, 10)\nreturnClosure()(4, 10) // addWithClosure(4, 10)\n\nYou've returned addWithClosures whose type is (Int, Int) -> Int as well.  If there is no () at the end, it is considered as a constant/variable.\nReturn Closure Directly\nYou may return a closure block directly instead of addWithClosures.\nfunc returnClosureDirectly() -> ((Int, Int) -> Int) {\n  return { (number1, number2) in number1 + number2 }\n}\nreturnClosureDirectly()(4, 10) // 14\n\nYou may use the short from instead.\nfunc returnClosureDirectlyTwo() -> ((Int, Int) -> Int) {\n  return { $0 + $1 }\n}\nreturnClosureDirectlyTwo()(4, 10) // 14\n\nPass Closure\nCreate a function whose parameter accepts () -> String.

You may sign up for my mailing list if you are interested in learning about reactive programming with RxSwift and MVVM.\nWe've covered the basics of closures in Swift. From now on, difficulty of this chapter will dramatically increase. Before you step onto the arena, I recommend you to read my articles and practice on your own until you become well-versed with the closure syntax. If not, you will suffer.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to initialize an object using a closure block and the meaning of lazy in the Swift Programming Language.\n"},"course/functional-swift/lazy-init-closures.html":{"url":"course/functional-swift/lazy-init-closures.html","title":"Lazy Init with Closures","keywords":"","body":"Lazy Init with Closures\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Chapter 3 of Intro to Functional Swift. There are two objectives. The first is to learn how to initialize an object using a closure block. The second is to understand when, where, how, and why we use the lazy keyword in the Swift Programming Language.\nProblem\nHow to initialize an object with a closure?\nUnconventional Way\nIf you've followed tutorials online or looked through open source projects, it's not uncommon to initialize UI components with the following way.\nimport UIKit\n\nlet box: UIView = {\n  let view = UIView()\n  return view\n}()\n\nHowever, a lot of students fail to explain because they simply copy.\nCreate UI Components\nTo appreciate the unconventional method, let us begin the \"normal\" way to create UI components programmatically.\nlet buttonSize = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100)\n\n// ViewControllerOne\nlet bobButton = UIButton(frame: buttonSize)\nbobButton.backgroundColor = .black\nbobButton.titleLabel?.text = \"Bob\"\nbobButton.titleLabel?.textColor = .white\n\n// ViewControllerTwo\nlet bobbyButton = UIButton(frame: buttonSize)\nbobbyButton.backgroundColor = .black\nbobbyButton.titleLabel?.text = \"Bobby\"\nbobbyButton.titleLabel?.textColor = .white\n\nIt is tedious.\nCreate Button with Function\nYou may create a function instead.\nfunc createButton(enterTitle: String) -> UIButton {\n  let button = UIButton(frame: buttonSize)\n  button.backgroundColor = .black\n  button.titleLabel?.text = enterTitle\n  return button\n}\ncreateButton(enterTitle: \"Yoyo\")\n\nHowever, when you build apps, it is unlikely that buttons look identical. Therefore, the function may require multiple parameters for customization. It becomes more tedious and readability decreases.\nIntroducing Unconventional Way\nThe unconventional way uses a closure block to initialize an object.\nCreate Object with Closure\nFirst, let us figure out how to create an object using a closure block.\nDesign a Human struct\nstruct Human {\n  init() {\n    print(\"Born 1996\")\n  }\n}\n\nCreate an instance called, bobInstance.\nlet createBob = { () -> Human in\n  let human = Human()\n  return human\n}\n\nlet bobInstance = createBob()\n\nYou've created two constants: createBob and bobInstance. Unnecessary.\nInitialize in Single Line\nlet bobby = { () -> Human in\n  let human = Human()\n  return human\n}()\n\nNow, bobby contains the human object.\nCreate UIView Unconventionally\nLet us apply the same principle to creating a UIView object.\nlet bobView = { () -> UIView in\n  let view = UIView()\n  view.backgroundColor = .black\n  return view\n}()\n\nlet bobbyView = { () -> UIView in\n  let view = UIView()\n  view.backgroundColor = .black\n  return view\n}()\n\nThe closure block has no parameter. Therefore, you no longer have to define the type explicitly - 3001_intro_closures_part1\nlet newBobbyView: UIView = {\n  let view = UIView()\n  view.backgroundColor = .black\n  return view\n}()\n\nYou only have to define the type of newBobbyView as UIView.\nIntroducing Lazy Var\nThe lazy keyword is used in front of a variable.\nclass IntenseMathProblem {\n  lazy var complexNumber: Int = {\n    1 * 1\n  }()\n}\n\nlazy properties are not initialized until you access them.\nlet problem = IntenseMathProblem() // no value for complexNumber\nproblem.complexNumber // now, complexnumber is 1\n\nApplication\nYou may use lazy to sort your database.\nclass SortFromDataBase {\n  // Data\n  lazy var sortNumberFromDatabase: [Int] = {\n    // Caluation and sorting\n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n  }()\n}\n// SortFromDataBase().sortNumberFromDatabase\n\nYou do not want to sort your entire database. It would burn a lot of computing power.\nThe same principle applies to image compression.\nclass CompressionManager {\n  lazy var compressedImage: UIImage = {\n    let image = UIImage()\n    // Compress the image\n    // Logic\n    return image\n  }()\n}\n\nRules\n\nYou can’t use lazy with let since there is no initial value, and it is attained later when it is accessed.\nYou can’t use it with a Computed property since computed property is always recalculated (requires CPU) when you modify any of the variables that has a relationship with the lazy property.\nlazy is only valid for members of a struct or class\n\nResources\nSwift Lazy Initialization with Closures\nSource Code\n3003_lazy_init_closures.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to initialize an object using closures instead of the tedious method above. I do not use Storyboard. In fact, I have a \"library\" of UI Components so that I don't waste time typing all day. I just copy the closure block from the library and modify a little. Second, you've learned to use the lazy keyword in front of a property that requires heavy computing.\nIn the following lesson, you will discover a unique behavior of closures.\n"},"course/functional-swift/capture-lists.html":{"url":"course/functional-swift/capture-lists.html","title":"Capture Lists","keywords":"","body":"Swift Capture Lists\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 4 of Intro to Functional Swift. Today, you will discover a unique behavior of closures, and how to make it right.\nDiscovery Stage\nFirst, let us create two variables.\nvar a = 0\nvar b = 0\n\nDesign Closure\nCreate a closure block which prints a and b.\nlet newClosure = { print(a, b) }\nnewClosure() // (0, 0)\n\nDesign Closure Array\nCreate an array whose type is [() -> ()]. newClosure will be added to closureArray.\nvar closureArray: [() -> ()] = []\nvar i = 0\n\nAppend Closure\nLet us add multiple closure blocks to the array using a for-in loop.\nfor _ in 1...5 {\n  closureArray.append {\n    print(i)\n  }\n  i += 1\n}\n// i is 5 by now\n\nExecute Closure\nLet us call the function.\nclosureArray[0]() // 5 &#x1F632;\nclosureArray[1]() // 5 &#x1F914;\nclosureArray[2]() // 5 &#x1F628;\nclosureArray[3]() // 5 &#x1F62D;\nclosureArray[4]() // 5 &#x1F631;\n\nYou might have expected each element to print, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. However, each closure uses the final value of i which is 5 at the end of the loop.\n\nImportant: A closure block is  a reference type. You will learn more in Chapter 5.\n\nCharacteristic of Closure\nLet us dig deeper.\nDesign Closure\nvar c = 0\nvar d = 0\n\nlet smartClosure: () -> () = { _ in\n  print(c, d)\n}\n\nFirst, modify the value of c and d. Second execute the closure.\nc = 9\nd = 9\nsmartClosure() // (9, 9)\n\nsmartClosure() prints (9, 9). When the value of c and d mutate, the change is reflected on the closure by default.\nIntroducing Capture List\nLet us destroy the default behavior.\n\nStrategy: Do not reference. Copy\n\nAdd an array [a, b] before in. The array is referred to as a capture list.\nlet smarterClosure: () -> () = { [c, d] in\n  print(c, d)\n}\n\nsmarterClosure() // (9, 9)\n\nNow , attempt to modify the value of c and d\nc = 10\nd = 10\n\nExecute smarterClosure. You will discover that the change is not reflected on the closure anymore.\nsmarterClosure() // (9, 9)\n\nThe capture list \"copies\" the value of c and d at the particular time the closure was created. It become invincible.\nDestroy Unique Behavior\nLet us go back to the early example with the for-in loop to append the closure block to the array.\nDesign Closure\nvar smartClosureArray: [() -> ()] = []\nvar j = 0\n\nAppend Closure\nCapture j\nfor _ in 1...5 {\n  smartClosureArray.append { [j] in\n    print(j)\n  }\n  j += 1\n}\n\nYou may rebrand j. In this case, I will refer to j as num within the closure block.\nfor _ in 1...5 {\n  smartClosureArray.append { [num = j] in\n    print(num)\n  }\n  j += 1\n}\n\nExecute\nLet us find out whether you've killed the default behavior.\nsmartClosureArray[0]() // 0 ☝️\nsmartClosureArray[1]() // 1 &#x1F4AA;\nsmartClosureArray[2]() // 2 &#x1F381;\nsmartClosureArray[3]() // 3 &#x1F389;\nsmartClosureArray[4]() // 4 &#x1F385;\n\nResources\nCapture List in Closures\nSource Code\n3004_capture_lists.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned the default behavior of a closure block which is identical to that of instances created with class objects. In fact, closures are reference types. In Chapter 5, however, you will discover some of problems that may arise due to the default behavior.

In this lesson, the goal is to master the protocol syntax before you take full advantage of what it offers on the table.\nProblem\nProblem: Protocols, who are you?\n\nAnalogy: Protocol is like a basketball coach. He/she tells players what to do, but he/she doesn't know how to dunk.\n\nDrawbacks of OOP\nBefore implementing protocols, you should be aware of drawbacks from solely relying on OOP.\n\nWhen you subclass, you have to inherit properties and methods which you may not need. The object becomes unnecessarily bloated.\nWhen you make a lot of super classes, it becomes extremely hard to navigate between each class and fix bugs/edit.\nSince objects are referencing to the same place in memory, if you make a copy and create a small change its property, it can mess up the rest. (Mutability due to reference)\n\nDesign Protocol\nCreate a protocol called, Humanable. It contains two properties and one method. Do not worry about get and set for now.\nprotocol Humanable {\n  var name: String { get set }\n  var race: String { get }\n  func sayHi()\n}\n\nCreate a class that conforms to Korea just like how you would subclass.

Passing data between classes using the delegate pattern is the fundamental way we, developers, receive information from the operating system. For instance, the user opens your app through a push notification, the iOS notifies and send information about the launch method to a class called, AppDelegate in which we have access to. This lesson is not about protocol oriented programming. Instead, you will utilize protocols to send data between classes or structs.\nProblem\nPass data between classes\n\nAdvice: You just have to memorize it. It's a gift from Apple engineers. Take it. Do not question why it works. But, find out why it is useful.

It is possible since secondVC conforms to PassDataDelegate.\nfirstVC.delegate = secondVC // you are sending data to classTwo\n\nWhen you set the relationship as above, you may call a method from firstVC along with its custom data. You may use the data in secondVC.\n//: Assign Delegate\nfirstVC.delegate = secondVC\nfirstVC.delegate?.passData(data: \"Hello, 1231231\")  \n// \"You've entered Hello, 1231231\"\n\nWhen the the passData method is called from the firstVC, secondVC contains now receives the data and may execute any lines of code.\n\nAnalogy: Imagine firstVC is an operating system (delegator) while secondVC is the class (delegate) that receives information from the OS.\n\nSource code\n4004_delegate.playground\nResources\nIntroduction to Delegate in Swift\nConclusion\nThe delegate pattern is tough to describe how it exactly works because it's a tool provided by Apple engineers.

You will learn the definition of the term \"memory\" in the context of the Swift Programming Language. By the end, you will understand how objects are initialized and destroyed by the operating system.\nProblem\nDeallocate and allocate objects with ARC\nWhat is Memory\nThere are primarily two places to store data: 1. RAM or 2. Hard Disk. The term \"memory\" refers to management of space of RAM.\n RAM is like a fridge\nWhen an object is initialized, it is physically stored on RAM. Since the space is limited, the object should be removed when unused. The process is known as deallocation. You will learn how to deallocate objects using ARC, Automatic Reference Counting.\nDesign Passport\nCreate a class called, Passport. It contains two properties whose types are Human?and String. The Human class defined below.\nclass Passport {\n  var human: Human?\n  let citizenship: String\n\n  init(citizenship: String) {\n    self.citizenship = citizenship\n    print(\"\\(citizenship) passport generated\")\n  }\n  deinit {\n    print(\"I, paper, am gone\")\n  }\n}\n\nDesign Human\nCreate a class called, Human.  It contains two properties whose types are Passport? and String.\nclass Human {\n  var passport: Passport?\n  let name: String\n\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n    print(\"\\(name) generated\")\n  }\n\n  deinit {\n    print(\"I, \\(name), gone\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The deinit block runs automatically when the object no longer exists on its RAM.\n\nCreate Instances\nLet us create an object without var or let.\nPassport(citizenship: \"Republic of Korea\")\n// \"Republic of Korea passport generated\"\n// \"I, paper, am gone\"\n\nIronically, the Passport object has been deallocated immediately after initialized. Let us create a variable that has a reference to Passport.\nvar myPassport = Passport(citizenship: \"The Mars\")\n// \"The Mars passport generated\"\n\nThe Passport object is not deallocated. The phenomenon is due to Automatic Reference Counting. If an object has a reference, it stays. Conversely, there is no reference, the object gets deallocated automatically.\n\nThe Only Rule: If the reference count reaches zero, the object is deallocated.\n\nCreate Instances\nCreate two instances one with Human and the other one with Passport.\nvar bobby: Human? = Human(name: \"Bobby\")\nvar passport: Passport? = Passport(citizenship: \"Republic of Korea\")\n\nLet us visualize the relationship.\n\nDeallocate\nYou may set the relationship as nil.  \nbobby = nil // deallocated\npassport = nil // deallocated\n\n\n\nImportant: When you set the variable as nil, you destroy the reference, not the object itself. The object is deallocated usually since the reference count reaches zero.\n\nDiscover Retention Cycle\nHowever, we do not live in an ideal world. Even if you set the reference as nil, the object may stay in the RAM forever.\nCreate Instances\nCreate two instances: bob and myPassport.\nvar bob: Human? = Human(name: \"Bob\")\nvar myPassport: Passport? = Passport(citizenship: \"Republic of Korea\")\n\nCreate a relationship between the instances\nbob?.passport = myPassport\nmyPassport?.human = bob\n\nLet us visualize the relationship\n\nThe Human object has two references from bob and Passport. The Passport object has two references from myPassport and Human.\nDeallocation\nLet us set the relationship from bob and myPassport as nil. However, it is not deallocated.\nbob = nil // Human not deallocated\nmyPassport = nil // Passport not deallocated\n\n\nThe Human object's reference count is one from the Passport object. The Passport object's reference count is one from the Human object. There is no way to deallocate both of them. The current situation is called, retain cycle or memory leak.\nSo solve the problem, you may set one of the relationship as weak which does not increase the reference count.\nclass Passport {\n  weak var human: Human?\n  let citizenship: String\n}\n\n\nCurrently, the Human object has one reference count from bob only since the weak reference does not increase the reference count.\nDeallocation\nLet us attempt to deallocate the objects.\nbob = nil  \n// \"I, Bob, gone\"\n\nThe Human object is deallocated since the reference count reaches zero.\n\nYou may destroy the Passport object\nmyPassport = nil\n// \"I, paper, am gone\"\n\n\n\nImportant: There is no such thing as retain cycle in structs and enums.\n\nSource Code\n5001_intro_memory_management.playground\nResources\nMake Memory Management Great Again\nConclusion\nFirst, you've learned the definition of Memory Management in the concept of the Swift Programming Language. Always think about the fridge as well as the sour milk. You only want foods that are nice and fresh. Second, when you set the variable as nil, it does not mean destroying the object. It means removing the reference.  Last, it's all about the reference count.

You may wonder which variable should be set as weak. The #1 rule is, a weak property has a reference to a class object which more likely to stays longer, and eventually has greater importance. For example, if the SendingVC object has a weak reference from the recevingVC property, the object will be deallocated immediately since the reference count is zero.\nIn the following lesson, you will discover the pitfall of using closures due to the unique behavior you've learned in Chapter 3, 3004_capture_lists\n"},"course/memory-management/closure_retain_cycle.html":{"url":"course/memory-management/closure_retain_cycle.html","title":"Closure Retain Cycle","keywords":"","body":"Closure Retention Cycle\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 3 of Swift Memory Management. In Intro to Functional Swift, you've discovered the unique behavior of closures, and soon noticed that they are reference types like classes. From the previous lesson, however, you must be careful using references due to retain cycle.\nProblem\n\nHow to use capture lists to prevent retain cycle in closures\nWhen to use unowned\n\nDesign Class\nFirst, create a called, BobClass. It has two properties, bobClosure and name whose types are (() -> ())? and String.\nclass BobClass {\n  var bobClosure: (() -> ())?\n  var name: String = \"Bob\"\n\n  init() {\n    bobClosure = { print(\"Bob the Developer\") }\n  }\n\n  deinit {\n    print(\"Bobclass gone\")\n  }\n}\n\nLet us call the closure.\nvar bobClass: BobClass? = BobClass()\nbobClass?.bobClosure!()\n// \"Bob the Developer\"\n\nLet us visualize the relationship.\n\nThe closure block is separate from the BobClass object.  The bobClosureproperty has a reference to the closure block.\nSince the BobClass object as one reference from the bobClass property, you may deallocate the object.\nbobClass = nil\n// \"Bobclass gone\"\n\nLet us visualize.\n\n\nImportant: Notice the closure block has been also deallocated due to the reference count of zero.\n\nRetain Cycle\nLet us create a reference from the closure block.\nclass BobClass {\n  var bobClosure: (() -> ())?\n  var name: String = \"Bob\"\n\n  init() {\n    bobClosure = { print(\"\\(self.name) the Developer\") }\n  }\n\n  deinit {\n    print(\"Bobclass gone\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The self refers to the object created by BobClass.\n\nNow, let us deallocate.\nbobClass = nil\n// Not deallocated\n\nLet us visualize the relationship to see the retain cycle.\n\nThere is a retain cycle between the BobClass object and the closure block.\nSolution\nThere are two ways.\nWeak\nThe first way is to use a weak var. The closure should have a relationship as shown by the image below.\n\nTo achieve the result above, you must use capture lists. You will capture self as a weak reference.\nclass BobClass {\n  var bobClosure: (() -> ())?\n  var name: String = \"Bob\"\n\n  init() {\n    bobClosure = { [weak self] in\n      guard let object = self else {\n        return\n      }\n\n      print(\"\\(object.name) the Developer\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nHowever, the capture self within the closure has turned into an optional type. Let us review the rule of weak.\n\nA weak reference allows the referencing object to becoming nil (this happens automatically when the referenced object is deallocated)\nBased on the rule above, the referencing object/variable must be optional\n\nUnowned\nYou may capture self, as a non-optional type with unowned. Like weak, it does not increase the reference count.\nclass BobClass {\n  var bobClosure: (() -> ())?\n  var name: String = \"Bob\"\n\n  init() {\n    bobClosure = { [unowned self] in\n      print(\"\\(self.name) the Developer\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nunowned states that the closure block must have a non-nil reference to the BobClass object. If the object is deallocated, it will cause a runtime error analogous to force-unwrapping nil.\n\nMore Unowned\nOne example is not enough.\nDesign Independent Class\nCreate a class called Owner. It contains a property whose type is CreditCard?.\nclass Owner {\n  var creditCard: CreditCard?\n  deinit { print(\"Owner gone\") }\n}\n\nDesign Dependent Class\nCreate a class called CreditCard. It contains a non-optional property whose type is Owner.\nclass CreditCard {\n  unowned let owner: Owner\n\n  init(enterOwner: Owner) {\n    owner = enterOwner\n  }\n\n  deinit { print(\"Card gone\") }\n}\n\nCreate Instances\nvar bob: Owner? = Owner()\nvar myCard = CreditCard(enterOwner: bob!)\nbob?.creditCard = myCard\n\nLet us visualize.\n\nLet us deallocate.\nbob = nil\n// \"Owner Gone\"\n\nIt works, since the Owner object has one reference from the bob property.\nWhen myCard attempts to access its unowned property of owner, however, scary stuff happens.\nmyCard.owner // Run-time Error\n\nBased on the definition of unowned, it must have a non-nil reference to the object. Since the Owner object has been deallocated, it crashes.\n\nIf self will never be deallocated before the closure block, use unowned. If you try to access the value of an unowned reference after that instance has been deallocated, you’ll get a runtime error.\n\nSource Code\n5003_closure_retention_cycle.playground\nResources\nSwift Retention Cycle in Closures and Delegate\nConclusion\nLet us recap. Like classes, closures are reference types, so you must be aware of retain cycle. To prevent one, you use capture lists to set the reference from the closure to self as weak or unowned. Remember, when you set the reference as weak, the closure captures self as an optional type because the closure must be able to break the reference. If you use unowned, however, the object or variable must have a non-nil reference. The relationship can't be broken as you've seen in the Owner and Credit card example. You may use unowned if you are certain that the referenced object will not deallocated before the referencing object. If not, it will cause a run-time error.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn one of the dreaded topics in closures: escaping and auotoclosures. \n"},"course/memory-management/@escaping-@autoclosure.html":{"url":"course/memory-management/@escaping-@autoclosure.html","title":"Escaping and Autoclosures","keywords":"","body":"Escaping and Autoclosures\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the last lesson of Swift Memory Management. You will learn at which circumstances you use escaping and autoclosures. No fear closures.\nProblem\nWhat are those?\nEscaping Closures\n\nDefinition: If the closure block is executed after the function returns, you must add @escaping.\n\nScenario 1\nCreate an array whose type is [() -> Void].\nvar closureBlocks: [() -> Void] = []\n\nCreate function whose parameter type is () -> Void. The function will take the parameter and append to the closureBlocks array.\nfunc funcWithClosure(closure: @escaping () -> Void) {\n  closureBlocks.append(closure)\n}\n\nThe @escaping keyword is added since the closure can be called after the function returns/executes.\nScenario 2\nAsynchronous operation does not execute code line-by-line. Instead, it runs many at the same time.\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc funcWithNetworkingClosure(closure: @escaping () -> Void) {\n  DispatchQueue.global().async {\n    closure() // Ex) downloading\n  }\n}\n\nThe @escaping is added automatically.\nWhen you pass a closure block to the function, the closure block is executed even after the function returns.\nfuncWithNetworkingClosure {\n  for _ in 1...1000 {\n    print(\"downloading\")\n  }\n}\n\n// \"downloading\"\n// \"downloading\"\n// ...\n// execute other operations\n// \"downloading\"\n// \"downloading\"\n// execute other operations\n\n\nNote: If you wish to learn more about multi-tasking and asynchronous operations,, you may read Intro to Grand Central Dispatch in Swift 3 with Bob\n\nNormal Function\nA normal function is @nonescaping by default. In other words, the closure is executed before the function returns/finishes.\nclass Normal {\n  let name = \"Bob\"\n\n  func normalFunctionWithClosure(closure: (String) -> Void) {\n    closure(self.name)\n  }\n}\n\nNormal().normalFunctionWithClosure { (myName) in\n  print(myName)\n}\n\nWhen you execute the function, the closure block is initialized and deallocated as the function returns. The function also gets deallocated. It happens almost simultaneously. If the function is @escaping, however, the closure block is not deallocated while the function block is.\nBenefits of Non-Escaping\n\nThere is no retain cycle for non-escaping functions since everything is deallocated\nYou may use self keyword without worrying about memory leak\nPerformance and the ability for the compiler to optimize\n\nIntroducing @autoclosures\nfunc checkIDCard(hasCard: () -> Bool) {\n  if hasCard() {\n    print(\"You've an ID\")\n  }\n}\n\ncheckIDCard(hasCard: { return true})\ncheckIDCard(hasCard: { true })\ncheckIDCard { true }\n\nThe @autoclosure keyword allows you to pass a closure block with no brackets.\nfunc checkIDCard(hasCard: @autoclosure () -> Bool) {\n  if hasCard() {\n    print(\"You've an ID\")\n  }\n}\n\ncheckIDCard(hasCard: true)\n\nLazy Init Capture\nYou've learned how to initialize an object with lazy and closures. However, you must be careful of potential retain cycle. Let us find out if there is one.\nCreate Lazy\nclass BobGreet {\n  var name = \"Bob the Developer\"\n\n  lazy var greeting: String = {\n    return \"Hello, \\(self.name)\"\n  }()\n\n  deinit {\n    print(\"I'm gone, bruh &#x1F646;‍\")}\n}\n\nThe closure block as a strong reference to self. However, let us attempt to deallocate regardless.\nDeallocate\nvar bobGreet: BobGreet? = BobGreet()\nbobGreet?.greeting\nbobGreet = nil // \"I'm gone, bruh &#x1F646;‍\"\n\n\nImportant: a closure block with a lazy property is @noescape by default.\n\nSource Code\n5004_escaping_autoclosures.playground\nResources\nIntro to Grand Central Dispatch in Swift 3 with Bob\nConclusion\nYou've learned 3 concepts. First, a function requires the @escaping keyword if the closure block in the parameter is executed after the function returns. Second, the @auotoclosure keyword is used to enter a closure block without brackets. However, the closure must have no parameters. Lastly, there is no retain cycle in lazy properties.\n"},"course/memory-management/conclusion.html":{"url":"course/memory-management/conclusion.html","title":"Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"Swift Memory Management\nYou've successfully completed Chapter 5, Swift Memory Management.

In Lesson 2 and 3, you've learned how to create retain cycles in the delegate pattern and closures. Be aware when you use reference types over value types.

It is certainly useful, yet you will discover the pitfall of the Swift protocol. Nonetheless, you will eventually work around the problem using the brain.\nLet us begin.\n"},"course/generic-protocol/associated-type.html":{"url":"course/generic-protocol/associated-type.html","title":"Intro Protocol Associated Type","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Protocol Associated Type\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the first lesson of Generic Protocols. In Chapter 4, Protocol Oriented Swift, you've mastered how to set protocol requirements. In this chapter, you will learn how to set the requirements generic, providing freedom and scalability.\nProblem\nHow to create generic protocols\n\n#1 Rule: Type must be defined before compiled.\n\nDesign Generic Struct - Review\nCreate a generic struct that has one property whose name is property.\nstruct GenericStruct {\n  var property: T?\n}\n\nWhen you initialize, you may define T implicitly or explicitly.\nlet explicitly = GenericStruct()\n// T is Bool\nlet implicitly = GenericStruct(property: \"Bob\")\n// T is String\n\nDesign Normal Protocol\nTo appreciate generic protocols, let's go back to your past. Design a protocol that has one property requirement whose name is property in String.\nprotocol NormalProtocol {\n  var property: String { get set }\n}\n\nDesign Class\nCreate a class called, NormalClass that conforms to NormalProtocol.\nclass NormalClass: NormalProtocol {\n  var property: String = \"Bob\"\n}\n\nproperty must be String. This ain't free. There is an alternative.\nIntroducing Generic Protocol\nWhen you design a protocol, you may add associatedtype which is analogous to typealias. Unlike typealias, the type is not defined.\nprotocol GenericProtocol {\n  associatedtype myType\n  var anyProperty: myType { get set }\n}\n\nThe type, myType, of anyProperty will be defined by either classes, structs, or enums.\nDefine Associated Type\nCreate a struct called, SomeStruct and conforms to GenericProtocol. As the requirement, anyProperty must be present. However, you may implicitly define the type of myType based on the value you assign to anyProperty.\nstruct SomeSturct: GenericProtocol {\n  var anyProperty = 1996 // myType = Int\n}\n\nstruct NewStruct: GenericProtocol {\n  var anyProperty = \"Bob\" // myType = String\n}\n\nDefine Associated Type with Typealias\nAs an alternative, you may define the type of myType explicitly by creating typealias.\nstruct ExplicitStruct: GenericProtocol {\n  typealias myType = Bool\n  var anyProperty = true  \n}\n\nSource Code\n6001_intro_associated_type.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to create generic protocols by implementing associatedtype. Like generic structs, the type of associatedType must be defined by the structs, classes, or enums that conform to the protocol. There are two ways to specify the type of associatedType. You may implicitly define it based on the value you assign. Second, or you may explicitly create a typealias that define the type upfront.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to add limitation/constraints to protocol extension like generic constraints. \n"},"course/generic-protocol/protocol-extension-constraints.html":{"url":"course/generic-protocol/protocol-extension-constraints.html","title":"Type Contraints","keywords":"","body":"Protocol Extension and Type Constraints\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of Generic Protocols. In Chapter 1, you've learned how to add constraints to generic functions with the example of LOL classes. Likewise, you may add constraints to a protocol extension so that the default implementation may only apply to specific classes and structs.\nProblem\nLimit the scope of Protocol Extension with where and Self\nGeneric Function - Review\nCreate a called LOL and create a function called addLOLClassOnly. The parameter of the function only works with value whose type is LOL.\nclass LOL {}\nfunc addLOLClassOnly(array: [T]) { }\naddLOLClassOnly(array: [LOL()])\n\nDesign Protocol\nCreate a protocol called, GenericProtocol. Create SomeClass and SomeStruct of which conform to the protocol.\nprotocol GenericProtocol {\n  associatedtype myType\n}\n\nclass SomeClass: GenericProtocol {\n  typealias myType = String\n}\nclass SomeStruct: GenericProtocol {\n  typealias myType = Int\n}\n\nDesign Protocol Extension\nYou may add constraints/conditions to extension by adding a where clause.\nCreate an extension that its default implementation applies to those whose associated type, myType is String\nextension GenericProtocol where myType == String {\n  static func introduce() {\n    print(\"Yo, I'm Bob\")\n  }\n}\n\nClasses, structs, and enums with myType as String contain the introduce() static method.\nSomeClass.introduce() // \"Yo I'm Bob\"\nSomeStruct.introduce() // Error\n\nYou may also add another where clause by adding ,. Let us apply the extension to SomeClass only.\nextension GenericProtocol where myType == String, Self == SomeClass {\n  static func introduce() {\n    print(\"Yo, I'm Bob\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nNotes: Self refers to the class/struct/enum that conforms to the protocol.\n\nDesign Pre-Defined Associated Type\nIn the previous lesson, you've left associatedtype to be defined by the Self. Yet, you may pre-define the type within the protocol.\nprotocol FamilyProtocol {\n  associatedtype familyType = Int\n  var familyMembers: [familyType] { get set }\n}\n\nIf you create a struct that conforms to FamilyProtocol, the required property, familyMembers has the type of [Int].\nstruct NumberFamily: FamilyProtocol {\n  var familyMembers: [Int] = [1, 3, 4]\n}\n\nSource Code\n6002_Protocol Extension and Type Constraints.playground\nConclusion\nLike generic constraints, you've learned how to limit the scope of protocol extensions by implementing where clauses. What a powerful tool. It prevents you from creating bloated objects filled with unnecessary methods and properties.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to override pre-defined associated type.\n"},"course/generic-protocol/override-associated-type.html":{"url":"course/generic-protocol/override-associated-type.html","title":"Override Associated Type","keywords":"","body":"Override Protocol Associated Type\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 3 of Generic Protocols.

A protocol oriented paradigm certainly carries a number of benefits over traditional object oriented programming. However, using protocols for every execution could potentially be an overkill for certain implementations. The folder and cell example in Lesson 3 does not need a wrapper class to type erase. At the end of the day, it is your decision to choose which methods that you prefer. I recommend you to think over before you use any letter that has to do with p in the Swift Programming Language.

Before you learn intermediate and advanced in later lessons, let us get everyone on the same page.\nProblem\nLet's Review\nTypes of Enumeration\n\nBasic Enumerations\nEnumerations that have Raw Values\nEnumerations that have Associated Values\n\nBasic Enumerations\nCreate an enum called Compass. It contains 4 cases.\nenum Compass {\n  case north\n  case south\n  case east\n  case west\n}\n\nYou define multiple cases in a single line\nenum Planet {\n  case mercury, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune\n}\n\nTo initialize, you choose one of the cases.\nlet earth = Planet.earth // init\n\nYou may run through a switch statement to identify the enum type.\nswitch earth {\ncase .earth:\n  print(\"Mostly safe\")\ndefault:\n  print(\"Not a safe place for me\")\n}\n\n// \"Mostly safe\"\n\nRaw Value\nAn enumeration may contain value. Swift supports the following types for the value of an enum:\n\nInt\nFloat\nString\nBool\n\nRaw Value: String\n enum Food: String {\n   case pizza\n   case banana\n   case chicken\n   case bigMac\n }\n\nlet stringValueFromPizza = Food.pizza.rawValue\nprint(stringValueFromPizza) // pizza\n\nRaw Value: Int\nenum Days: Int {\n  case mon, tue, wed, thu, fri = 10, sat, sun\n}\n// mon = 0, tue = 1, wed = 2, ... , fri = 10, sat = 11\n\nlet myDay = Days.fri.rawValue\nprint(myDay) // 10\n\nInitialization from Raw Value\nYou may create an enum object using a raw value. it may fail. Therefore, the returned object may be nil.\nlet possibleeDay = Days(rawValue: 10) // returns optional\nprint(possibleeDay!)\n\nYou may combine with a switch statement.\nif let someDay = Days(rawValue: 3) {\n  switch someDay {\n  case .sat, .sun:\n    print(\"Weekends!!\")\n  default:\n    print(\"Weekdays!\")\n  }\n} else {\n  print(\"No such day exists\")\n}\n\nAssociated Value\nEach case may contain value along with it.\nExample from Doc\nenum Barcode {\n  case upc(Int, Int, Int, Int)\n  case qrCode(String)\n}\n\nvar qrCode = Barcode.qrCode(\"XYZ\")\nvar upcCode = Barcode.upc(4, 2, 5, 5)\n\nValidation\nDetermine if the instance is Barcode.qrCode using an else-if statement. The process is similar to implicit unwrapping.\nif case let Barcode.qrCode(value) = qrCode {\n  print(\"This is a qrcode\")\n  print(value)\n}\n\nYou may capture the associated value of the instance, qrCode using case let. You've named the captured value as value.\nDetermine whether he upcCode instance is Barcode.upcCode.\nif case let Barcode.upc(numberSystem, manufacturer, product, check) = upcCode {\n  print(\"numbersystem:\", numberSystem)\n  print(\"manufaturer:\",manufacturer)\n  print(\"product:\",product)\n  print(\"check:\",check)\n}\n\nValidation with Switch Statement\nInstead of checking each enum object individually using an else-if, you may use a switch statement.\nlet code = upcCode\n\nswitch code {\ncase .upc(let numberSystem, let manufacturer, let product, let check):\n  print(\"UPC: \\(numberSystem), \\(manufacturer), \\(product), \\(check).\")\ncase .qrCode(let productCode):\n  print(\"QR code: \\(productCode).\")\n}\n\nThe code below is identical as above.

When alive, the player has a number of hearts/lives. If the number goes to zero, the player becomes dead.\nDesign Protocol\nCreate a protocol called, LifeSpan. It contains one property, numberOfHearts and two mutating functions which will be used to increase/decrease a player's heart.\nprotocol LifeSpan {\n  var numberOfHearts: Int { get }\n  mutating func increaseHeart() // heart +1\n  mutating func getAttacked() // heart -1\n}\n\nDesign Enum\nCreate an enum called Player. It conforms to LifeSpan. There are two cases. The object can be either dead or alive. The alive case contains an associated value called currentHeart. It also contains a gettable computed property, numberOfHearts. numberOfHearts is determined based on whether self is case or alive.\nenum Player: LifeSpan {\n  case dead\n  case alive(currentHeart: Int)\n\n  var numberOfHearts: Int {\n    switch self {\n    case .dead: return 0\n    case let .alive(numberOfHearts): return numberOfHearts\n    }\n  }\n\n  mutating func increaseHeart() {\n    switch self {\n    case .dead:\n      self = .alive(currentHeart: 1)\n    case let .alive(numberOfHearts):\n      self = .alive(currentHeart: numberOfHearts + 1)\n    }\n  }\n\n  mutating func getAttacked() {\n    switch self {\n    case .alive(let numberOfHearts):\n      if numberOfHearts == 1 {\n        self = .dead\n      } else {\n        self = .alive(currentHeart: numberOfHearts - 1)\n      }\n    case .dead:\n      break\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The break keyword is used to escape out of the switch statement.\n\nPlay Game\nLet us test. Begin with .dead.\nvar state = Player.dead // .dead\nstate.increaseHeart()  // 1\nstate.numberOfHearts // 1\nstate.increaseHeart() // 2\nstate.getAttacked()  // 1\nstate.getAttacked() // 0, .dead\nstate.numberOfHearts // 0\n\nCustom Operators (Taste)\nFirst design a enum, GameAction.\nenum GameAction {\n  case Start\n  case Pause\n  case Stop\n  case Restart(delay: Int)\n}\n\nCheck whether == works.\nGameAction.Stop == GameAction.Stop // Error\n\nYou may create your own operator. Follow the code below.\nfunc ==(lhs: GameAction, rhs: GameAction) -> Bool {\n  switch (lhs, rhs) {\n  case (.Start, .Start), (.Pause, .Pause), (.Stop, .Stop):\n    return true\n  case let (.Restart(lhsDelay), .Restart(rhsDelay)):\n    return lhsDelay == rhsDelay\n  default:\n    return false\n  }\n}\n\nGameAction.Restart(delay: 10) == GameAction.Restart(delay: 10) // true\n\n\nNote: You will more in de-tail in Chapter 8: Advanced Swift.\n\nSource Code\n7004_protocol_enum.playground\nConclusion\nSome may feel uncomfortable with the excessive usage of enums. That is good. You are challenged by new ways of thinking. However, you are right. You may not need to use enums. Just like protocols, it could be an overkill for certain implementations. In the following lesson, you will learn a recursive enum structure to add and multiply numbers. After, I will show you alternatives that are much simpler and more zen. Just like protocols, enums are not the ultimate savior. You have to learn and study every tool to a point you are able to calculate tradeoffs and benefits by foreseeing the future. \n"},"course/advanced-enum/recursive-enum.html":{"url":"course/advanced-enum/recursive-enum.html","title":"Recursive Enum","keywords":"","body":"Recursive Enums\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 5 of Advanced Enum. In this lesson, you will discover how to create a complex enum structure using a recursive. Some may have not heard the term, \"recursive\" before. I will briefly show you what a recursive function is. Nonetheless, this lesson may be challenging.\nProblem\nEnum contains its own enum type\nRecursive Function\nLet us begin this lesson by learning about what a recursive function is.\nfunc recursiveFunction() {\n  print(\"Hi!\")\n  recursiveFunction() // loop\n}\n\nWhen you execute the recursiveFunction, it never ends.\nrecursiveFunction()\n// \"Hi'\"\n// \"Hi'\"\n// ...\n// \"Hi\"\n\nDesign Enum\nCreate an enum, ArithmeticExpression. It contains three cases with associated types. Two of the cases contain its own enum type, ArithmeticExpression.  The indirect keyword is needed to indicate that the enum is a special animal.\nindirect enum ArithmeticExpressions {\n  case number(Int)\n  case addition(ArithmeticExpressions, ArithmeticExpressions)\n  case multiplication(ArithmeticExpressions, ArithmeticExpressions)\n}\n\nYou may initialize using the number case or with addition or multiplication.\nArithmeticExpressions.number(4)\nArithmeticExpressions.addition(.number(4), .number(4))\n\nlet five = ArithmeticExpressions.number(5)\nlet four = ArithmeticExpressions.number(4)\n\nYou may create a recursive function to execute, addition and multiplication.\nfunc evaluate(_ expression: ArithmeticExpressions) -> Int {\n  switch expression {\n  case let .number(value):\n    return value\n  case let .addition(left, right):\n    return evaluate(left) + evaluate(right)\n  case let .multiplication(left, right):\n    return evaluate(left) * evaluate(right)\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: You may have to look at the function multiple times until you get it. Don't give up.\n\nLet us execute the function.\nevaluate(ArithmeticExpressions.number(4))\nevaluate(ArithmeticExpressions.addition(.number(4), .number(4))) // 8\nlet multiplicationEnumType = ArithmeticExpressions.multiplication(.number(4), .number(4))\nevaluate(multiplicationEnumType)  // 16\n\nAlternative Normal Enum\nA recursive enum to do addition and multiplication is an overkill. Let us use a normal one.\nenum Operation {\n  case addition(Int, Int)\n  case multiplication(Int, Int)\n\n  var result: Int {\n    switch self {\n    case let .addition(number1, number2):\n      return number1 + number2\n    case let .multiplication(number1, number2):\n      return number1 * number2\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nExecute.\nOperation.addition(4, 4).result\n\nHowever, I personally don't like the you have to use result to get the final value.\nAnother Alternative\nYou may create a struct along with functions.\nstruct StructOperation {\n  func addTwoNumbers(_ number1: Int, _ number2: Int) -> Int {\n    return number1 + number2\n  }\n  func multiplfyNumbers(number1: Int, number2: Int) -> Int {\n    return number1 * number2\n  }\n}\n\nExecute\nStructOperation().addTwoNumbers(4, 9)\n\nThis feels better. Yet, let us make it more zen.\nMy Choice\nUse closures instead.\nstruct MathOperation {\n  static let addition: (Int, Int) -> Int = { $0 + $1 }\n  static let multiplication: (Int, Int) -> Int  = { $0 * $1 }\n}\n\nExecute\nMathOperation.addition(10, 10) // 20\n\nThe best.\nSource Code\n7005_recursive_enum.playground\nReferences\nThe Swift Programming Language (Swift 3.1)\nConclusion\nOne of the code smells is \"needless complexity\". You don't need to be fancy. Remember, protocols and enums are double edged swords. If you don't know how handle them well, it may hurt or even kill you. In Chapter 8, you will learn in-detail about how an indirect enum works using a binary tree data structure.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to combine enums with generics. \n"},"course/advanced-enum/generic-enum.html":{"url":"course/advanced-enum/generic-enum.html","title":"Generic Enum","keywords":"","body":"Generic Enums\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 6 of Advanced Enum. Chapter 1, you've learned how to create generic structs, classes, and functions. In Chapter 5, you've learned how to create generic protocols using associated types. In this lesson, you will learn how to create generic enums. When you hear the term generic, you already know the purpose. It is to provide scalable and reusable code, following the principle of DRY.\nProblem\nA little more complex associated value\nIntroducing Generic Enums\nLike structs, classes, and functions, the syntax looks identical.\nenum Information {\n  case name(T)\n  case website(T)\n  case age(U)\n}\n\nLet us initialize.\nInformation.name(\"Bob\") // Error\n\nThe compiler is able to recognize T as String based on \"Bob\". However, the type of U is not defined yet. Therefor, you must define both T and U explicitly as shown below.\nInformation.age(20)\n\nOptionals with Enum\noption-click on Optional. It is an enum with associated value defined as T. There are two ways to create optional types: 1. Traditional 2. Native\n// Traditional\nlet explicitOptionals = Optional(\"Bob\")\n// Native\nlet quickOptionals: String? = \"Bob\"\n\nprint(explicitOptionals) // Optional(\"Bob\")\nprint(quickOptionals) // Optional(\"Bob\")\n\nCustom Optionals\nLet us attempt to create our own \"optional\" type.\nenum MyOptional {\n  case none // nil\n  case some(T)\n\n  init(_ anyValue: T) {\n    self = MyOptional.some(anyValue)\n  }\n}\n\nLet us initialize\nMyOptional(\"Bobby\")\n\nSafe unwrapping for MyOptional does not work.  TheOptional enum probably has its own custom operators.\nif let value = MyOptional {\n  print(value)\n} // Error\n\nSource Code\n7006_generic_enum.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to create generic enums with associated value which allows enums like Optional to convert any type into its own optional type. If you have two or more non-concrete types such as T and U, make sure you explicitly define them.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how error handling was done in the past with generic enums. \n"},"course/advanced-enum/result-type.html":{"url":"course/advanced-enum/result-type.html","title":"Result Type","keywords":"","body":"Error Handling with Enum Result Type\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the last lesson of Chapter 7. You will learn how to combine two enums to throw and handle errors without using the Swift 3.1 error handling syntax.\nProblem\nError Handling back then\nHTTPS Request\nThe example can be designed for a website.\nDesign Error\nCreate a enum, HTTPError. It contains two error cases: nonFound404 and forbidden403.\nenum HTTPError {\n  case notFound404\n  case forbidden403\n}\n\n\nNote: The Error protocol is not required\n\nDesign Result Type\nCreate a generic enum, ResultType. Like Optional, it contains two cases: Success(T) AND failure(HTTPError).\nenum ResultType {\n  case success(T)\n  case failure(HTTPError)\n\nTest\nlet success = ResultType.success(\"Bob\")\nlet failure: ResultType = ResultType.failure(.notFound404)\n}\n\n\nImportant: Remember to define T when you use the failure case.  \n\nDesign Function and Return Error\nCreate a function called findSubDomain. You need to enter String. It will return ResultType.\nfunc findSubDomain(subdomain: String) -> ResultType {\n  // Switch Statement\n  switch subdomain {\n  case \"business\":\n    return ResultType.failure(.forbidden403)\n  case \"blog\":\n    return ResultType.failure(.notFound404)\n  default:\n    return ResultType.success(\"Found website\")\n  }\n}\n\nExecute the function and create an instance, result, to store the returned value of ResultType.\nlet result = findSubDomain(subdomain: \"business\")\n\nHandle Error\nOnce the function returns, you may use a classic switch statement to determine whether the instance is .failure or .success.\nswitch result {\ncase let .success(subDomainName):\n  print(subDomainName)\ncase let .failure(errorType):\n  switch errorType {\n  case .notFound404:\n    print(\"Not Found: 404\")\n  case .forbidden403:\n    print(\"Not Allowed: 403\")\n  }\n}\n\nNo need to get fancy with try, catch, and throw\nSource Code\n7007_result_type_error_handling\nConclusion\nIt's up to you which method you prefer, the old or the new. The iOS platform itself uses the new syntax since it provides higher readability due to the explicit keywords such as try, catch, and throws. However, you still need to know how to send and handle errors using a ResultType enum because some developers still prefer the earlier method. You've got to know all.\nIn the following chapter, you will have one more lesson about The Swift error handling. There is one keyword you've got to know.\n"},"course/advanced-enum/conclusion.html":{"url":"course/advanced-enum/conclusion.html","title":"Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"Conclusion\nYou've successfully completed Chapter 7, Advanced Enum. In Lesson 1, you've learned the three types of enums: normal, raw value, and associated value. In Lesson 2, you've learned how to add properties and methods so that you may use enums for your current projects including UIColor andStoryboard.  The rest is history.\nThe number one design goal for developers is be able to pick and choose instead of typing.  Debugging refers to a process of removing of bugs. Programming must be producing bugs. That means, we, developers, must write less but produce more.\nStill, enums are often overlooked because developers tend to use structs and classes without giving a second thought. However, enums do not represent itself as a all-in-one solution. You, the leader, must choose the right tool depending on your situation And, the only way to know which is the right tool, you must use every other tool.

So far, you've learned how to create generic structs, classes, enums, and functions. Today, you will learn how to add generics within generics. Next, you will learn the meaning of indirect enums using the binary data structure.\nProblem\n\nLearn how to created nested generic enum\nLearn more about recursive enum with binary tree\n\nNested Generics\nLet us take your game to the next level with generics.\nBefore Swift 3.1\nTo appreciate nested generics, let us look into your/my past.\nDesign Generic Enums\nCreate two generic enums: Gadget and Company.\nenum Gadget {\n  case smartphone\n  case laptop\n  case fridge\n  case others(T)\n}\n\nenum Company {\n  case Samsung\n  case Apple\n  case Sony\n  case others(T)\n}\n\nDesign Struct\nCreate a struct called, Product. It contains three properties: company, gadget, and reviews.\nstruct Product {\n\n  let company: Company\n  let gadget: Gadget\n  let reviews: [T]\n\n  init(enterCompany: Company, enterGadget: Gadget, enterReview: [T]) {\n    company = enterCompany\n    gadget = enterGadget\n    reviews = enterReview\n  }\n}\n\nThe init method seems unpleasant. Let us attempt to initialize.\nlet myProduct = Product(enterCompany: .Apple,\n                                    enterGadget: .fridge,\n                                    enterReview: [\"Good, silver, but expensive\"])\n\nThere must be an alternative.\nSwift 3.1\nNow, you may add a generic type within a generic type. Create a generic struct, Team. Within the struct, it also contains another generic structure, TeamMember.\nstruct Team {\n  struct TeamMember {\n    let name: T?\n    let age: T?\n  }\n}\n\nLet us use nested generics using the Productexample.\nstruct NestedProduct {\n\n  indirect enum Gadget {\n    case smartphone\n    case laptop\n    case fridge\n    case others(T)\n  }\n\n  indirect enum Company {\n    case Samsung\n    case Apple\n    case Sony\n    case others(T)\n  }\n\n  let company: Company\n  let gadget: Gadget\n\n  let reviews: [T]\n\n  init(enterCompany: Company, enterGadget: Gadget, enterReView: [T]) {\n    company = enterCompany\n    gadget = enterGadget\n    reviews = enterReView\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The indirect keyword is needed in front of Company and Gadget due to a bug. You will learn more about the meaning of indirect soon.\nCyclic Dependency: A relation between two or more modules which either directly or indirectly depend on each other to function properly. The tight coupling of the mutually dependent modules which reduces or makes impossible the separate re-use of a single module.\n\nLet us initialize using the generic enums\nlet myFridge = NestedProduct(enterCompany: .Apple,\n                                             enterGadget: .laptop,\n                                             enterReView: [\"Good\"])\n\nYou are following the principle: write less, produce more.\nRecursive Enum\nBefore I introduce you to the meaning of indirect, let us take a look the characteristic of enum associated value.\nFirst, let us design blueprints using class, struct, and enum.\nclass BobClass {}\nstruct BobStruct {}\nenum BobEnum {\n  case bobCase\n}\n\nLet us initialize\nlet bobClass = BobClass()\nlet bobStruct = BobStruct()\nlet bobEnum = BobEnum.bobCase\n\nCreate an enum, MyEnum, with associated value.\nenum MyEnum {\n  case myClass(BobClass)\n  case mySruct(BobStruct)\n  case myEnum(BobEnum)\n}\n\nLet us initialize.\nMyEnum.myClass(bobClass)\nMyEnum.mySruct(bobStruct)\nMyEnum.myEnum(bobEnum)\n\nLet us visualize.\n Reference vs Value Types in Associated Value\n\nNotes: The associated value of myStruct and myEnum are stored while myClass is referenced somewhere in the cloud.\n\nThe Meaning of indirect enum with Binary Tree\nLet us create an enum called, Tree. There are two cases, either Empty or Node. The Node case has associated value.\nindirect enum Tree {\n  case Empty\n  case Node(value: Int ,left: Tree ,right: Tree)\n}\n\nLet us create a couple nodes.\nlet tree1 = Tree.Node(value: 1, left: Tree.Empty, right: Tree.Empty)\nlet tree2 = Tree.Node(value: 2, left: Tree.Empty, right: Tree.Empty)\nlet tree3 = Tree.Node(value: 3, left: tree1, right: tree2)\n\nLet us visualize\n\nLet us add two more nodes\nlet tree1 = Tree.Node(value: 1, left: Tree.Empty, right: Tree.Empty)\nlet tree2 = Tree.Node(value: 2, left: Tree.Empty, right: Tree.Empty)\nlet tree3 = Tree.Node(value: 3, left: tree1, right: tree2)\nlet tree4 = Tree.Node(value: 4, left: tree3, right: tree5)\nlet tree5 = Tree.Node(value: 5, left: Tree.Empty, right: Tree.Empty)\n\nLet us visualize\n\n\nImportant: indirect enums no longer store associated value. It references. For instance, the associated value of tree4 has a reference to tree5 and tree3. tree3 has a reference to tree1 and tree2.\n\nRecursive Function to Sum Values\nLet us calculate the sum of every tree from the top using a recursive enum.\nfunc evaluateTree(tree:Tree) -> Int {\n  switch tree {\n  case .Empty:\n    return 0\n  case .Node(let value, let left, let right):\n    return value + evaluateTree(tree: left) + evaluateTree(tree: right)\n  }\n}\n\nLet us test.\nevaluateTree(tree: tree1) // 1\nevaluateTree(tree: tree3) // 6\n\n\nImportant: You may have to dissect the function multiple times to understand. I recommend you to start using a smaller node.\n\nSource Code\n8001_nested_generics_recursive_enum\nReferences\nGeneric struct crashes because of “cyclic metadata dependency\nMy Question on Stack Overflow\nConclusion\nThere were two objectives. First, you've learned how to design beautiful code with nested generics. Second, you've learned the difference between normal enums and indirect enums when it comes to associated value. Remember, indirect enums point rather than store. Some may be baffled by the recursive function to add the value of all nodes. Well, I can't help you much. I recommend you to start with one node and move up.\nIn the following lesson, finally, you will learn how to create custom operators. \n"},"course/advanced-swift/advanced-operators.html":{"url":"course/advanced-swift/advanced-operators.html","title":"Advanced Operators","keywords":"","body":"Advanced Operators\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of Advanced Swift.

In chapter 1, you've learned the native way to send and handle error using the error handling syntax including try, catch, and do.

Let's take a look.\nProblem\nWhat is rethrow?\nWorth Learning\nLet us find out whether Swift engineers use rethrow in the first place. option-click on Array.

Playground is messed up.\n\nPass Non-throwable Function\nYou may also pass a non-throwable function to rethrowableFuncWithErrorHandling.\nrethrowableFuncWithErrorHandling(function: nonThrowableFunc)\n\n\nImportant: Since the function, rethrowableFuncWithErrorHandling.is marked with rethrows, you may also enter a non-throwable function even though the parameter requires a throwable function. This is the why we, developers, do not even question the existence of the rethrows keyword.\n\nSource Code\n8003_advanced_error_handling\nConclusion\nCongratulations, you've mastered the Swift Error Handling. To recap, you may add the rethrows keyword to a function whose  parameter also can throws an error. However, you may still pass a non-throwable function since the original is identified as rethrows. This is the reason why we developers use APIs created Apple engineering without realizing that the original function may also throw an error.\nIn the following lesson, you will finally understand the statement, \"Swift is a protocol oriented language\". \n"},"course/advanced-swift/equatable-comparable.html":{"url":"course/advanced-swift/equatable-comparable.html","title":"Equatable and Comparable","keywords":"","body":"Equatable and Comparable Protocol\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 4 of Advanced Swift. Since Chapter 4, you've learned practical aspects of using protocols along with associated types and extensions.

When it comes to learning new features, I've been using the microwave analogy that things just work because smart engineers have designed them. But, there are times you might have to create your own custom microwave. For example, you might want to create one for yourself during the winter because it's hard to code with frozen fingers. Then, you've got know all. In this lesson, let's find out the secret behind the Swift for-in loop and learn how to create our own custom types that have the magic.\nProblem\nWhat goes under the hood of a for-in loop.\nTake For Granted\nWhen you first learned Swift or other programming languages, you've probably used the feature below without giving a second thought. (I didn't)\nlet iOSSkills = [\"Swift\", \"UIKIt\", \"RxSwift\", \"TDD\"]\nfor skill in iOSSkills {\n  print(skill)\n}\n// Prints \"Swift\"\n// Prints \"UIKIt\"\n// Prints \"RxSwift\"\n// Prints \"\"TDD\"\"\n\nLet us convert a String value into CharacterView and loop each character.\nfor character in (\"Bob the Developer\").characters {\n  print(character)\n}\n// \"B\"\n// \"o\"\n// \"b\"\n// ...\n// \"r\"\n\n\nImportant: The Swift for-in loop exists since Array and CharacterView both conforms to Sequence and IteratorProtocol.\n\nBehind the Scene\nFirst, the iOSSkill, whose type is Array conforms to Sequence, has the required method, makeIterator. The method returns an object that conforms to IteratorProtocol. The returned object has a required method called, next() which returns the next element with an optional type.\nvar skillIterator = iOSSkills.makeIterator()\n\nwhile let skill = skillIterator.next() {\n  print(skill)\n}\n\n// Prints \"Swift\"\n// Prints \"UIKIt\"\n// Prints \"RxSwift\"\n// Prints \"\"TDD\"\"\n\nIt also applies to Array.\nlet numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7]\nvar numbersIterator = numbers.makeIterator()\n\nnumbersIterator.next()\nnumbersIterator.next()\nnumbersIterator.next() // Optional(5)\nnumbersIterator.next()\nnumbersIterator.next()\nnumbersIterator.next()\n\nCustom Type\nSequence Protocol\nLet us create our own struct that conforms to Sequence.  The struct is called, MyCountdown. The struct has the required method, makeIterator. The method returns an object that conforms to ProtocolIterator.\nstruct MyCountdown: Sequence {\n  let start: Int\n\n  func makeIterator() -> CountdownIterator {\n    return CountdownIterator(self)\n  }\n}\n\nIteratorProtocol\nLet us create a struct, CountdownIterator that conforms to IteratorProtocol.  The struct contains the required method, next() which returns an element.\nstruct CountdownIterator: IteratorProtocol {\n  let countdown: MyCountdown\n  var times = 0\n\n  init(_ countdown: MyCountdown) {\n    self.countdown = countdown\n  }\n\n  mutating func next() -> Int? {\n    let nextNumber = countdown.start - times\n    guard nextNumber > 0\n      else { return nil }\n\n    times += 1\n    return nextNumber\n  }\n}\n\nTesting\nLet us find out if the makeIterator and next methods work.\nvar threeTwoOne = MyCountdown(start: 3)\nvar iterator = threeTwoOne.makeIterator()\niterator.next() // 3\niterator.next() // 2\niterator.next() // 1\n\nMagic\nThe MyCountdown. is eligible for the Swift for-in loop.\nfor count in threeTwoOne {\n  print(\"\\(count)...\")\n}\n\nSource Code\n8005_sequence_iterator.playground\nResources\nSwift Standard Library Functions\nSwift Change Log\nSwiftdoc.org\nReferences\nAPI Reference - IteratorProtocol\nRay Wenderlich - Building Custom Collection Swift\nProtocols in Swift by Chris Eidhof\nHow To Conform to the Sequence Protocol - Natasha The Robot\nConclusion\nFirst, you've learned the hidden implementation by the Swift for-in loop. To make types eligible for the magic, it has to conform to the Sequence protocol and has the required method that returns an object that conforms to IteratorProtocol. The iterator object also has the required method of next() to get the next element. The word sequence sounds as if types must look like a dictionary, array, or set. It doesn't have to. Again, the purpose of this lesson was not introduce you to various protocols. It was to let you know how native types conform to pre-written protocols and has added features like a for-in loop. If you wish to study, I recommend you to take a look at the references and read the documentation.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to execute swift files using Terminal and how Xcode sends error messages, a.k.a, the red marks.\n"},"course/advanced-swift/intro-test-driven.html":{"url":"course/advanced-swift/intro-test-driven.html","title":"Intro to Test Driven Development","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Test Driven Swift\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the last lesson of Learn Swift with Bob.

It returns either true or false.\nassert(true) // pass\n\nLet us create a function that may return assert(false).\nfunc enterName(name: String) {\n  if name == \"\" {\n    assert(false, \"You must enter a full name\")\n  } else if name == \"Bob\" {\n    assert(false, \"There is only one Bob\")\n  }\n}\n\nenterName(name: \"Bob\")\n// Error\n\nHere is another example.\nvar expectedResult = 10\nvar actualResult = 10\n\nassert(actualResult == expectedResult, \"The actual result doesn't match with the expected\")\n\nYou may use #file and #line\nprint(\"File: \\(#file)\")\nprint(\"Line: \\(#line)\")\n\nAssertionFailure\nIt destroys no matter what.\nimport Foundation\nlet randomNumber: Int = Int(arc4random_uniform(3))\n\nswitch randomNumber {\ncase 0, 1, 2:\n  print(randomNumber)\ndefault:\n  assertionFailure(\"Unexpected index \\(randomNumber)\")\n}\n\nIf randomNumber contains any number besides 0, 1, 2, it will crash the program.\nPrecondition\nIt is identical to Assert. However, it is also called when Swift is compiled at -0.\nlet expectedNumber = (1, 3)\nlet actualNumber = (1, 3)\n\nprecondition(actualNumber == expectedNumber, \"\\(actualNumber) is not the same as \\(expectedNumber)\")\n\n\nNote: I don't recommend using Precondtion or PreconditionFailture since the user has no idea what the error is.\n\nPreconditionFailure\nIdentical as AssertionFailure. It is called during -O.\nFatalError\nIt is useful for terminating an app no matter what.\nlet number: Int = Int(arc4random_uniform(100))\n\nfunc enterNumberReturnString(index: Int) -> String {\n  switch index {\n  case 0, 1, 2:\n    return \"\\(number)\"\n  default:\n//    assertionFailure(\"Unexpected index \\(number)\")\n//    abort()\n    fatalError(\"Unexpected index \\(number)\")\n  }\n}\n\n\n@noreturn, the compiler confirms that the marked function will not return.
