Swift with Bob\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nAs a developer whose first programming language is Swift, I've taken online courses from major platforms. However, I have been frustrated by a lack of detailed explanation from instructors. They tend to focus on final products, thus missing out the fundamentals. I was confused by which design principles to follow, and why. Soon after I've been blogging for the last 5 months, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine. I've received hundreds of emails and questions regarding how to write code that does not violate principles such as DRY, modularity, and readability. As a result, I've decided to create this course dedicated for my younger self. I believe it all comes down to the fundamentals which I lacked in the beginning.\nReference\nThis is a platform for my students to download the source code, lecture notes, and scripts. As a life-long student, I've always wanted to have a complete overview of what I've learned. Most instructors avoid documenting since it takes effort besides making videos alone. I chose the road less traveled to help my students and differentiate myself from the competitive marketplace.\n\nUntil the course get officially released, please consider it as a rough draft.\n\nPersonal Motivation\nI feel grateful for what learning offers in my life. It would have been impossible for me to create this course and communicate in English. I've decided to devote my career providing affordable education channels for all people globally. As a person who has lived in third world countries and also attended college in NYC, I understand, education is the way for anyone rise up and increase a standard of living and quality of life. To pursue this grand goal, I have started off with teaching iOS development to raise funds and increase my personal brand. \nMailing List\nIf you are interested in receiving regular updates on upcoming courses with discounts, you easily sign up through the button below.

Since Sept 17, 2016, I've left college in NYC to pursue this goal. Currently, I have started off with teaching how to make iOS apps and the Swift programming language. In 2017, I attempt to raise as much as funds through teaching so that I may build a company that provides a platform for learning.\nCalendar\n\n\nFavorite Quotes\n\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I - I took the on less traveled by, and that has made all the difference. - Robert Frost\n\n"},"RESOURCES.html":{"url":"RESOURCES.html","title":"Resources","keywords":"","body":"iOS Development \nLast Update on Sat Apr 08 2017 12:05:43 GMT+0900 (KST)\nI try to stay consistent and provide as much as value for my students and readers.

This monitor doesn't require a power cord. It only needs a USB port. It's useful for client meetings as well.\nMonitor\n\n\nAcer 23.8 Inch Monitor\nIt's affordable, and I use it to record tutorials and any other activities.  An extra monitor is a must for anyone who is serious about programming.\nMonitor\n\n\nApple's Magic Keyboard\nIt prevents a neck-strain because I no longer have to turn my next to see the side monitor. There is no delay time between input and output. Also, there is a rechargeable battery so I get to save time.\nKeyboard\n\n\nApple's Magic Mouse 2\nIt looks aesthetic, and I love the fact that it is so thin that I can carry it in my pocket otherwise I had to carry a small bag. Similar to the keyboard above, it doesn't require any extra battery cells, so there is no recurring fee or time spent on going to the supermarket.\nMouse\n\n\n2013 MacBook Pro 15 Inch\nI don't think I have to explain. The link provides the cheapest offer for now. It is around $800 which is pretty good deal considering I can probably use it for another 3 year. So, you'd only pay like $250 per year which is affordable.\nLaptop\n\n\n\n\nThe cheaper ones are refurbished. I'd recommend you to get a new one since it just feels better and you are going to use them for another 2-3 years. If you spot anything cheaper, make sure it is not the first generation. The second generation contains rechargeable battery: Magic Keyboard 2(MLA22LL) and Magic Mouse 2(MLA02LL)\n\nBlogging and Course Production\n\n\n\nGadget\nMy Usage\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nCanon EOS 700D\nI've noticed an iPhone 7 Plus just can't beat the depth that the DSLR camera offers. I use my camera to record all of my introduction and conclusion videos. It's affordable and great for those who want to get started and make videos.\nCamera\n\n\nBluetooth Selfie Stick\nInstead of extending my arm, I like to use it to show background and take pictures with my friends.\nCamera Tool\n\n\nToshiba 1TB Portable Hard Drive\nI can't store everything on my mac. So, this is just great even as a backup as well. If you are serious about making online courses or you have a lot images, it's just a must.\nStorage\n\n\nSamsung 64GB SD Card\nI used to record videos with a normal SD card but its writing speed was so slow that the recording stopped after a couple seconds. I had no issue with the SD card.\nStorage\n\n\nBlue Snowball USB Microphone\nAll of my YouTube tutorials and Udemy course videos are recorded with this microphone. I love it. Since I've lost its stand, I've been using a pizza box as you can see in my recent videos.\nMicrophone\n\n\nSony Camera Microphone\nI use it along with my camera since the Blue Snow Microphone is too big to carry it all the time.\nMicrophone\n\n\n\nProductive Home Office\nCurrently, I work at home and having the right work environment allows me to stay focused and spend less than on doing tasks that don't add much value to my production. Unlike the iOS Development Tools mentioned above, these are non-tech related gadgets that I crave.\n\n\n\nGadget\nWhy I Would Get\nCategory\n\n\n\n\n3-Piece Corner Desk\nI just need a long desk. I care about how things look because the environment influence my mind subconsciously. It's affordable as well.\nDesk\n\n\nLeather Chair\nSimilar to the phone stand and the desk, it just looks visually appealing. I tend to grab products that look good because I feel good.\nChair\n\n\niPhone Stand\nNot only it is visually aesthetic, but also it allows me to use my app instantly because I don't even need to grab, but just scroll with my finger comfortably.\nPhone Stand\n\n\nPhone Ring Stand\nI think it's just a must because it allows me to watch YouTube videos while eating food and right before I go to bed.\nStand\n\n\nSilver Laptop Stand\nIf I use a double monitor, it's essential for me to get a laptop stand  so that my next does not have to move up and down and stay align with the height of the monitor. It puts less stress. Also, the color matches with the laptop so it looks aesthetic.\nLaptop Stand\n\n\n\nWish List\n\n\n\nGadget\nWhy I wish\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nMacBook Pro 15.4-inch with Touch Bar\nI just want to take my laptop to the next level. I've been using my laptop but I just want it a little bit better so that I can render videos faster\nComputer\n\n\nSamsung 27-Inch Curved Monitor\nI have a descent monitor, but again, I've never had curved one before. So, I just want to try it out\nMonitor\n\n\nApple Airpods\nCurrently, I use Samsung's bluetooth earphone, but Airpods is just classy. I got hooked by Apple's video.\nHeadphones\n\n\nC Shape 4-in-1 Stabilizer\nAlthough I'm not a film maker, I'd love to watch one of these when I travel during summer breaks.\nCamera\n\n\n\n\nI'm going to buy these whenever I have a chance. These are just amazing.\n\nTravel\nI travel quite often because my family has been living in different parts of the world. Therefore, I always carry these products below so that I can stay productive even if I travel.\n\n\n\nTravel\nUsage\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nXiaomi 10000mAH\nI carry it everywhere because I blog and make tutorials with my phone. I also do a lot of social media and communication with my phone. It is indispensable.\nCharger\n\n\nTravel Universal Adapter Charger\nI hate wires and chargers because they take up a lot of space and wires cause massive headaches. But, the universal charger takes care of all the hassle for me\nCharger\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware \nHosting and Cloud Computing\n\n\n\nSaaS\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nDigital Ocean\nI use it to run virtual servers.

It's decentralized so the international wire transfer occurs within a day or two and it's cheap if you are dealing with money less than $10,000. Get started with sending £500 for free with the link\n\n\nQuickbooks\nIt creates invoice, track all my expenses, employee payrolls. It helps me prepare for my upcoming tax returns.\n\n\n\nSchedule & Events\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nCalendly\nThis is my favorite scheduling tool. You don't need to buy a premium account. It's free to use. It allows you to set date and time blocks when you are available, when you send your profile link to someone else, the person can choose the time based on their time zone. I use it all the time for scheduling. You can see my schedule here.  \n\n\nTito\nI've used Evenbrite to organize and schedule events. But, Tito provides a seamless experience for me. The landing page looks great. I recently purchased a ticket for the upcoming Swift conference.\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nGitbook\nI'm currently using Gitbook to document. It allows me to allow Markdown seamlessly with my favorite Text Editor and Github. If you want to get started, feel free to watch this tutorial.

You can find out what you could possibly create this theme here.\n\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\nApps\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nInbox by Gmail\nI love using this app instead of relying on iPhone's default mail or Gmail. The app automatically organizes items into separate groups through machine learning, and I may archive or read the entire group with a single swipe. As a person who receives a number of comments on social media, this app is just perfect for me\n\n\nDiscord\nAlthough Slack is okay, I use Discord because it's free for unlimited users. It's loved by gamers since it provides channels for voice calls. But, it also provides syntax and markdown highlighting. In fact, I have a group for my students to interact with each other.\n\n\n\nFeedback and Survey\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nTypeform\nI used to use Google Form, but Type form looks a little more engaging because it provides interactive experience and you can also add payment\n\n\n\nVideo Editing\nAdobe Premier Pro and Aftereffect\nProject Management\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nWrike\nWrike is an ideal project management solution for teams and businesses of all sizes: from solopreneurs and small startups to Fortune 500 firms.\n\n\nTrello\nTrello provides an overview. I use it to organize my weekly work.\n\n\n\n \n \nBooks \nI read 80-100 books a year. Although I'm 20, books allow me to gain insights and allow me to process any situation.\nSoftware Development\nAlthough I spend a majority of time learning iOS, I also attempt to learn design patterns, interview questions, and algorithms so that I can stay on top of the game.\n\n\n\nBook\nAuthor\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nCracking the Code Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions\nGayle McDowell\nAlgorithm & Data Structure\n\n\niOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide\nChristian Keur\niOS Development\n\n\n\nStartup\nAlthough my first startup failed, I incorporated and grew the team with close to a dozen employees.

However, don't let its readability and hype fool you. It's a complex language inspired by many programming languages out there. In fact, you will suffer, and I want it that way. Let me explain.\nEmbrace Struggle\nConsuming knowledge goes against the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics that things in nature want to remain scattered. What we do everyday defies the law. It's organic to struggle. It doesn’t mean struggles can't be fun. Perhaps, people attempt to climb the highest mountain and try to hold breath in icy water despite death threat. Struggles produce stories filled with hardships. They allow us to appreciate success.\nThis is one of my favorite songs called, Let Her Go by Passenger.\n\nOnly know you love her when you let her go\n\nDocument\nI'd like you to document your learning journey. You no longer have to create a website. You may blog on Medium or use Evernote. You may share with your friends. Your learning journey will be difficult. But once you get it and share with someone else, you will feel more accomplished. I guess that's why I love blogging.\nBe Skeptical\nI’m a biased human being. I hope you do not trust me all the way. &#x1F605; If you spot any practices that raise your eyebrows, make sure challenge me and come up with a better solution. Although I try to prevent that from happening through doing my homework, I encourage you to think outside of the box.\nBe Proactive\nYou might have seen those red error messages on the left side. I expect you to figure out and search what the issue is. Copy and paste the error message on Google. Ask me questions. Do whatever it takes. Do not move on without knowing the cause and how you could prevent them from occurring.\nI mentioned that learning is done by you, not me. I’m here to teach you how to catch fish. I’m going to show you how to use nets and fish rods. After this course, you are expected to use those tools on your own. You might cut yourself through sharp edges, but it's just a part of your learning journey and becoming a stronger version of yourself.\nYour Ideal Learning Stage\n\n\n\nStep\nDetail\n\n\n\n\nThe Why\nEach lesson should flow like a story. In the beginning, I start off with a problem statement. It consists of doubts and questions I personally encountered. For example, I would ask, what's the purpose of using optionals? A problem statement organically leads to why we learn such materials and features\n\n\nApplication\nAfter having gone through the specific problem statement by showing new features and how to use them, I present how it applies to real-life situations.\n\n\nResources\nI attach additional resources for you to study more. You may go further on your own.\n\n\nVisualization\nIt's your turn. I don't believe in practice problems. We no longer live in a world where there are fixed answers. You visualize how the feature you've learned can be applicable for your future endeavor. Albert Einstein said, \"Imagination is more important than knowledge\". Practice problems turn you into a machine. We have more than enough in 2017, by the current education system.\n\n\nTest\nIt's time to put your visualization into practice. You should fail. That's good. You are trying something new. \"Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough\" - Elon Musk\n\n\n\n"},"course/introduction/course-prerequisites.html":{"url":"course/introduction/course-prerequisites.html","title":"Prerequisites","keywords":"","body":"Course Prerequisites\nTo maximize your learning, you should be familiar with the following Swift syntax.\nSwift Fundamentals\nFor-In Loops\nfor _ in 1...100 {\n  print(\"Repeat\")\n}\n\n// \"Repeat\"\n// \"Repeat\"\n// ...\n\nSwitch Statement\nswitch number {\ncase 1...10 :\n  print(\"Your number is between 1 to 10\")\ndefault:\n  print(\"I don't know\")\n}\n\nVar vs Let\nlet imuttableName = \"Bob\"\nvar muttableName = \"Bobby\"\n\nimuttableName = \"SangJoon\" // Error\n\nElse-If Statement\nif isBobHansome {\n  print(\"He good\")\n} else {\n  print(\"That's okay\")\n}\n\nTypes\nlet string = \"String\"\nlet bool = true\nlet double = 20.0\nlet int = 20\n\nArray and Dictionary\nlet countries = [\"S.Korea\", \"USA\", \"Vietnam\", \"Malaysia\"]\nlet info = [\"Height\": 183, \"Age\": 20]\n\nFunction\nfunc returnName() -> String {\n  return \"Bob the Developer\"\n}\n\nBasic Operators\n1 + 1\n3 / 2\n2 * 4\n9 % 5\n\nIntro to Enums\nenum Race: String {\n  case asian\n  case white\n  case black\n  case hispanic\n}\n\nRace.asian.rawValue // \"asian\"\n\nObject Oriented Programming\nYou should be familiar with initialization, property, method, and inheritance\n class Human {\n   let name: String\n\n   init(enterName: String) {\n     name = enterName\n   }\n\n   func sayName() {\n     print(\"Hi, I'm \\(name)\")\n   }\n\n }\n\nIf you are not confident with any of those topics above, you may watch my videos I've for complete beginners below on YouTube.

If you've been frustrated by the red marks that appear on the left of your screen, you've come to the right place with me, Bob the Developer. Let's get started. If you have any questions, feel free to comment below.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/optionals.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/optionals.html","title":"Optionals","keywords":"","body":"Optionals\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the first lesson of the Swift Fundamentals with Bob. When I first started programming in Swift just like many of you, I took courses from Udemy, Treehouse, Lynda, and many more.\nHowever, I could not understand what those ? and ! stood for, and why we use them. Xcode kept telling me what to do on the left side. You probably know what I'm talking about. I got frustrated. It seemed like no courses gave me clear reasons how to use optionals, and most importantly, why Swift engineers have implemented such feature that is so unique compared to other programming languages. Well, if you have asked the similar question, I'm here for you.\nProblem\nWhy did Swift engineers implement optionals?\nImplicit and Explicit Type\nRules\n\nEvery variable type must be defined (Implicit/Explicit)\nThe type is inferred based on the value\n\n// String\nlet name: String = \"Bob\"          // Explicit\nlet newName = \"Bob the Developer\" // Implicit\n\n// Numbers\nlet myAge: Int = 20               // Explicit\nlet mySisterAge = 14              // Implicit\nlet myGPA: Double = 3.54          // Explicit\n\n\nReasons for the rules above Google Slide\n\nFetching Profile Picture\nWhen you fetch a profile picture from Facebook, it may return no value or nil. However, you may not store nil to a normal type based on the rule above.\n// If could return \"URL\" or \"nothing\"\n\n// Successful\nlet myProfileImageURL: String = \"https//facebook.com/bobthedeveloper\"\n// Error\nlet myProfilePictureURL: String = nil\n\nIntroduction to Optionals\nOptionals allow storing nil, a.k.a absence of value.\nlet myName: String? = nil\nlet yourName: String? = \"Bob Lee\"\n\nprint(myName) // nil   \nprint(yourName) // Optional(\"Bob Lee\")\n\nlet bobAge: Int? = nil\nlet robAge: Int? = 123\nlet danAge: Int? = 3\n\nOptionals Rules\n\nOptionals/Normal Types do not interact with each other\nConvert Optionals to Normal Types for usage. The process is also known as unwrapping.\n\n// robAge + danAge\n// Error\n\nOptionals Unwrapping\nThere are two ways to convert/unwrap optional types to normal types\n\nForced unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping\n\nForced Unwrapping\n You may convert by inserting ! at the end of  the variable/constant. Forced Unwrapping should be avoided since it causes a crash if the optional type contains nil.\nlet profileImageFromFacebook: String? = \"ImageURL...\"\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook) // Optional\n\nvar image = profileImageFromFacebook! // String? converted to String\n\nprint(image) // Normal Type\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook!) // Normal Type\n\nIn order to interact between variables, you must convert.\nlet newRobAge = robAge!\nlet newDanAge = danAge!\n\nnewRobAge + newDanAge // Good\n\nBad things happen when you try to force unwrap an optional type whose value contains nil.\nvar image: String? = nil\nlet normalImage = image!  // let normalImage = nil\n// Error\n\n\nYou can't store nil to a normal type in Swift. It violates the Swift rule.\n\nImplicit Unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping is another way to convert. However, even if an optional type contains nil, it does not break the system. Instead, it ignores. Implicit unwrapping is an added feature to an else-if statement.\nlet imageFromFaceBook: String? = \"Bob's Face\"\n\nif let normalImage = imageFromFaceBook {\n  print(normalImage)\n} else {\n  print(\"There is no image\")\n}\n\nNow normalImage is contain a normal type of String. You may use the normalImage constant within the block. If imageFromFaceBook. contains nil, Swift will run the else block instead.\nSource Code\n1001_optionals.playground\nResources \n\n\nConclusion\nYou've learned two fundamental concepts in the Swift programming language. The rule number one is that every variable type, even if optionals, has to be defined whether explicitly or implicitly. Second, there are two ways to unwrap optionals to normal types.  ! is used to force unwrap. if let is used to safely unwrap.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn why ? and ! automatically appear when you create an object and access its properties and methods.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/optional-chaining.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/optional-chaining.html","title":"Optional Chainings","keywords":"","body":"Optionals Chainings\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of The Swift Fundamentals. In the previous lesson, you've learned why we use optionals and the two ways to unwrap/convert.\nHowever, have you wondered why ? and ! automatically appear when you try to get properties and methods of an object? If you haven't, that's okay. You will find out. The goal is to prevent you from guessing. Let us find out what goes under the hood.\nProblem\nWhy do I see \"?\" and \"!\" when accessing methods and properties?\nOptional Chaining in UIKit\nYou might have seen something like this,\nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel().highlightedTextColor?.cgColor\n\nThe mysterious ? appears all of a sudden.\nDesign Human\nCreate a class called Human that contains a property, name and a method, sayHello().\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n\n  func sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello, I'm \\(name)\")\n  }\n}\n\nDesign Apartment\nCreate Apartment class that contains a property whose type is Human?.\nclass Apartment {\n  var human: Human?\n}\n\nInitialize Property\nCreate an instance of Apartment and assign its human property whose type is optional.\nvar seoulApartment = Apartment()\nseoulApartment.human = Human(name: \"Bobby\")\n\nCall Property and Method\nNow, try to grab the human property of seoulApartment. Since the type of human is optional, ? gets added automatically.\n\nRules: When you attempt to access a property whose type is optional, Swift will add ?. Anything that comes after the ? will be optional.\n\nvar myName = seoulApartment.human?.name // Always return an optional since human is optional.\n\nmyName is an optional type. Therefore, unwrapping is needed.\nif let name = myName {\n  print(name)\n}\nForce Unwrap\nYou may force unwrap, and it will return a normal type. However, there is no property intialized, it will crash.\nvar NYCApartment = Apartment()\nlet NYCResident = NYCApartment.human!.name // Error: No value for human\n\nSource Code\n1002_optional_chainings.playground\nResources\nMy Favorite Xcode Shortcuts\nConclusion\nNow, you no longer have to guess when to use ? and !. It should be particularly useful when you work with the UIKit objects. But, make sure safely unwrap.\nIn the next lesson, you are learn how to use a guard statement to implicitly unwrap multiple optionals, and why you use it instead of using a classic if let statement.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/guard-defer-statement.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/guard-defer-statement.html","title":"Guard and Defer Statement","keywords":"","body":"Guard Statement\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 3 of The Swift fundamentals. When I learned Swift as my first programming language,  I understood  an else-if statement. However, a guard statement confused the heck out of me. Some of you guys may feel the same way as I did. Don't worry. I'm here for you today. You will understand that a guard statement is just another for you to write an else-if statement. A guard statement promotes zenness. In other words, it adds clarity, emptiness, and lots of cloud and space.\nProblem\nIs there any better way to write an else-if statement? How do you safely unwrap multiple optionals?\nTypical else-if\nWithout having known guard statements, you probably have used a long else-if statement to indicate an error message block.\nfunc checkDrinkingAge() {\n  let canDrink = true\n\n  if canDrink {\n    print(\"You may enter\")\n    // More\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n\n  } else {\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    print(\"Let me take you to the jail\")\n  }\n}\n\nIssues with else-if\n\nNested brackets\nHave to read every line to spot the error message\n\nGuard Statement\nA guard block only runs if the condition is false, and it will exit out of the function through return. If the condition is true, Swift will ignore the block. Eventually, it provides an early exit and fewer brackets.\nfunc checkDrinkProgram() {\n  let iCanDrink = true\n\n  guard iCanDrink else {\n    // if iCanDrink == false, run this block\n    print(\"You can't drink\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  print(\"You may drink\")\n  // You may move on\n  // Come on.\n  // You may leave\n  // You don't need to read this.\n  // Only one bracket on the bottom: feeling zen.\n}\n\nUnwrap Optionals with Else-If\nA guard statement is not only useful for replacing an else-if statement, but also great for unwrapping optionals by minimizing the number of brackets. To compare, let's first begin how to unwrap multiple optional types using an else-if.\nFirst, there are three optional variables.\nvar publicName: String? = \"Bob Lee\"\nvar publicPhoto: String? = \"Bob's Face\"\nvar publicAge: Int? = nil\n\nThe Worst Nightmare\nfunc unwrapOneByOne() {\n  if let name = publicName {\n    if let photo = publicPhoto {\n      if let age = publicAge {\n        print(\"Bob: \\(name), \\(photo), \\(age)\")\n      } else {\n        print(\"age is mising\")\n      }\n    } else {\n      print(\"photo is missing\")\n    }\n  } else {\n    print(\"name is missing\")\n  }\n}\n\nThe code above certainly works but violates the DRY principle. It's atrocious. Let us break it down.\nSlightly Better\nThe code below is more readable than above.\nfunc unwrapBetter() {\n  if let name = publicName {\n    print(\"Yes name\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No name\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  if let photo = publicPhoto {\n    print(\"Yes photo\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No photo\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  if let age = publicAge {\n    print(\"Yes age\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No age\")\n    return\n  }\n}\n\nreturn within each else block is used to exit out of the function.\nUnwrap with Guard\nfunc unwrapOneByOneWithGuard() {\n  guard let name = publicName else {\n    print(\"Name missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  guard let photo = publicPhoto else {\n    print(\"Photo missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  guard let age = publicAge else {\n    print(\"Age missing\")\n    return\n  }\n  print(name)\n  print(photo)\n  print(age)\n}\n\nUnwrap Multiple Optionals with Else-If\nYou may unwrap multiple optional types at once.

Error Handling came across as daunting. I thought I had to be a professional debugger to fully utilize the feature. However,  I've soon discovered, it's nothing more than writing an else-if statement to deal with an error message block. The difference is the Swift Error Handling allows you to write cleaner, modular, and readable code. Let's dive into it.\nProblem\n\nHow do you warn your co-workers the function may result unexpected outcomes?\nWhat is a do-try block?\nHow do you distinguish between try?, try!, and try?\n\nDesign Safety Feature\nDetermine who may ride the roller coaster.\nfunc checkHeight(height: Int) {\n  if height > 200 {\n    print(\"You are going to hit your head and fall off\")\n    // Take him/her off from the ride\n    // Code ...\n    // Seatbelt tighten\n\n  } else if height \nProblem with Else-If alone\n\nBloated Function\nLack Modularity\nUncertainty\n\nError Handling\nError Handling is just additional way to write an else-if statement to deal with error messages\nDesign Error\nCreate an enum that conforms to Error protocol. Determine a few cases.  \nenum HeightError: Error {\n  case maxHeight\n  case minHeight\n}\n\nDesign Throwable Function\nCreate a function that can throw/return errors by inserting throws at the end of the function parameter.\nfunc checkHeightError(height: Int) throws {\n  if height > 200 {\n    throw HeightError.maxHeight\n  } else if height \nCall and Handle Error\nTo call a function that contains throws, the function requires try within a do block. A catch block is used to recognize and the error thrown by the function. If there is no error thrown, the catch block is ignored.\ndo {\n  try checkHeightError(height: 240)\n} catch HeightError.maxHeight {\n  print(\"Get out of here\")\n  // Logic\n} catch HeightError.minHeight {\n  print(\"Too short to ride\")\n}\n\nError Handling with Object Initialization\nDesign Error\nenum NameError: Error {\n  case noName\n}\n\nDesign Throwable Class\nWhen the user enters an empty string when initializing, the init method throws NameError.noName.\nclass Course {\n  var name: String\n\n  init(name: String) throws {\n    if name == \"\" {\n      throw NameError.noName\n    } else {\n      self.name = name\n      print(\"You've created an object!\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nInitialize and Handle Error\nCreate an object using try within a do-catch block.\ndo {\n  let myCourse = try Course(name: \"\")\n} catch NameError.noName {\n  print(\"Please make sure put something\")\n  // Logic\n}\n\nDistinguish Between try?, try!, and try\ntry is only used within a do-catch block. However, try? and try! can be used without it.\ntry?\nIt returns an optional value. If it throws an error, the result will be nil.\nlet newCourse = try? Course(name: \"Bob the Dev\") // returns Course?\nlet newDopeCourse = try? Course(name: \"\") // nil\n\ntry!\nIt returns a normal type.

You've also learned the differences between try, try?, and try!. You can only use try within a do-catch block. However, if you do not mind catching the error thrown, you may use try? and try! alone. Again, avoid using! since it may crash at any time.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn the final usage of ! and ? in the Swift Programming Language through type castingwhich allows you to convert types that are made with classes. &#x1F914;\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/type-casting.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/type-casting.html","title":"Type Casting","keywords":"","body":"Type Casting\nIntroduction\nWelcome to lesson 5 of The Swift Fundamentals with Bob. We've covered a number of !s and ?s since Lesson 1. You've got to know all. It is absolutely necessary for you to distinguish their usage in every situation.\nIn this lesson, you are going to learn how to convert types in objects that are created with classes. In fact, if you've used  Storyboard in iOS, you've been using type casting for a while. Let's go.\nProblem\n\nHow do you distinguish between as, as?, as!?\nWhy does Xcode keep telling me what to do?\n\nType Casting in UIKit\nYou've probably seen something like this.\nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel() as UIView\n\n The UIKit framework hierarchy\nHuman Class\nDesign a class called, Human that contains a single method.\nclass Human {\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi, I'm a human\")\n  }\n}\n\nHuman Subclass\nDesign Korean and Japanese which inherit from the Human class.\nclass Korean: Human {\n  func singGangNamStyle() {\n    print(\"Oppa Gangnam Style\")\n  }\n}\n\nclass Japanese: Human {\n  func doNinja() {\n    print(\"Shhh.....\")\n  }\n}\n\nCheck if everything works.\nlet bob = Korean()\nbob.introduce()\nbob.singGangNamStyle()\n\nType Casting\nNow, you may want to convert Korean to Human or Human to Koream. There are two ways: upcasting and downcasting.\nUpcasting\nUpcasting is all about going up to the base/super class. In the early example you've upcasted UILabel to UIView by usin as.\nlet newBob = bob as Human  // Korean -> Human\nnewBob.introduce()\nnewBob.singGangNamStyle() // Does not exist\n\nUpcasting Example in Swift\nvar name = \"Bob\" as Any\nvar number = 20 as Any\nvar anyArray = [name, number] // [Any]\n\nDowncasting\nDowncasting is the opposite of upcasting. For example, from Any to String would be downcasting. However, it may fail. As a result, there are two ways to downcast: Force downcasting or Implicit Downcasting.\nForce Downcasting\nIt does not return an optional type.  but if it fails, it crashes.\n// Force Downcasting\nlet newValue = anyArray[0] as! String\nlet newValue = anyArray[1] as! String // Error\n\n\nDowncasting only applies when you upcast first\n\nImplicit Downcasting\n It returns an optional type. If it fails, it returns nil.\nlet newNewValue = anyArray[0] as? Int\nprint(newNewValue) // Optional(20)\n\nType Casting in Practice\nCreate Instances\nlet shion = Japanese()\nlet lee = Korean()\nlet kenji = Japanese()\nlet park = Korean()\n\nCreate Array Using Upcasting\n let humans: [Human] = [shion as Human, lee as Human, kenji as Human, park as Human]\n\nAutomatic upcasting\nlet humans: [Human] = [shion, lee, kenji, park]\nlet humans = [shion, lee, kenji, park]\n\nLoop\nfor human in humans {\n  if let korean = human as? Korean {\n    korean.singGangNamStyle()\n  }\n\n  if let japanese = human as? Japanese {\n    japanese.doNinja()\n  }\n}\n\nUsage in iOS Development\nTypecasting can be used to group UI Components and add attributes as a whole.\nimport UIKit\n\nlet loginButton = UIButton()\nlet loginMessage = UILabel()\nlet loginView = UIView()\n\nlet UIComponents = [loginButton, loginMessage, loginView]\n\nfor component in UIComponents {\n  if let button = component as? UIButton {\n    // Change background color\n    // Add Title\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  if let label = component as? UILabel {\n\n  }\n\n  if let view = component as? UIView {\n\n  }\n}\n\nHowever, upcasting is not recommended since there is a better way to go about: Protocol Oriented Programming. You will find out more the differences soon.\n If you've worked with Storyboard, you have used type casting to identify the designated view controller.\nlet storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil)\nlet vc = storyboard instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"VC\") as! VC\n\nSource Code\n1005_type_casting.playground\nReference\nAnyObject and Any in Swift (Stack Overflow)\nConclusion\nI lied. I said Type Casting is used to convert types in classes, but you may also convert Int and String to Any even though they are made up of structs, not classes.\nUnnecessary upcasting isn't recommended among iOS developers because it's quite a bit of a headache to cast back and forth. Again, there is an alternative to go about when it comes to grouping objects together: Protocol Oriented Swift. We will learn more about it in Chapter 3.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/generics.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/generics.html","title":"Intro to Generics","keywords":"","body":"Generics\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 6 of The Swift Fundamentals with Bob. When you think of the word, \"generic\", what makes you think? Well, I'm sure you've thought of versatile code. Some of you guys be like, \"What'?\". I will walk you through. Remember, the number one goal is to write as little as possible, but produce as much.\nProblem\nI smell something.\n\nFor the reference read more about code smell\n\nYour Past\nLet us reflect on how we rolled in the past. Let's attempt to access each element in an array.\nlet highSchoolGPA = [2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.8, 3.5]\nlet favoritePeople = [\"Elon Musk\", \"Steve Jobs\", \"Kevin O'leary\"]\nlet favoriteNumbers = [3, 20]\n\nThe Worst way to access elements\nhighSchoolGPA[0]\nhighSchoolGPA[1]\nhighSchoolGPA[2]\n\nLoop and Print\nThis works as well.\nfunc printDoubleElement(array: [Double]) {\n  for GPA in array {\n    print(GPA)\n  }\n}\n\nfunc printStringElement(array: [String]) {\n  for person in array {\n    print(\"I love \\(person)\")\n  }\n}\n\nfunc printNumberElement(array: [Int]) {\n  for number in array {\n    print(\"I like \\(number)\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nNeedlessly many functions. It goes against the DRY principle.\n\nIntroducing Generics\nA generic function allows you to pass any value regardless of types.   \nfunc genericFunction(value: anything) {\n  print(value)\n}\n\nfunc genericFunctions(value: WHATEVER) {\n  print(value)\n}\n\nSwift infers the type of anything based on the input.\ngenericFunction(value: \"Bob\")  // value is String\ngenericFunction(value: true)    // value is Bool\n\nGeneric Loop\nLet us create a generic function.\nfunc printElement(array: [T]) {\n  for element in array {\n    print(element)\n  }\n}\n\nCall the function\nprintElement(array: highSchoolGPA)\nprintElement(array: favoritePeople)\n\n\nGeneric code enables you to write flexible, reusable functions, classes, enums, protocols, and structs subject to requirements that you define.\n\nNow only you can create generic functions, but also generic classes and structs. Let us begin with a non-generic struct.\nNon-Generic Struct\nstruct Family {\n  var members = [String]()\n\n  mutating func push(member: String) {\n    members.append(member)\n  }\n}\n\nNon-Generic Instance\nvar myFam = Family()\nmyFam.push(member: \"Bob\")\nmyFam.members\n\nWhat if you wish to create a struct whose type pre-defined as String, but Int? You probably have to create an entire new struct. It goes against the DRY principle.\nGeneric Struct\nstruct genericFam {\n  var members = [T]()\n\n  mutating func push(member: T) {\n    members.append(member)\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Object Explicitly\nNow, let us create an object from the generic struct. You have to specify the type you'd like to interact with.\nvar myGenericFamily = genericFam()\nmyGenericFamily.push(member: \"Bobby\")\n\nvar genericFamily = genericFam()\ngenericFamily.push(member: 123)\n\nCreate Object Implicitly\nHowever, the type of structs can be inferred based on the input.\nlet myHappyFamily = genericFam(members: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  // T becomes Int\n\nGeneric Extension\nYou may add an extension to generics for more features. Let us grab the first element in the members property.\nextension genericFam {\n  var firstElement: T? {\n    if members.isEmpty {\n      return nil\n    } else {\n      return members[0]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet geekFamilyMember = genericFam(members: [\"Bob\", \"Bobby\"])\nlet firstElement = geekFamilyMember.firstElement\n\nResources\nIntro to Generics in Swift with Bob\nSource Code\n1006_generics.playground\nConclusion\nTo recap, you've learned how to design generic functions and structs. In Chapter 6, you will more about advanced generics along with enums and protocols. If you feel uncomfortable with the syntax, I recommend you to watch the lecture again and refer to the article I've attached.\nYou've come a long way. I'm very proud of your progress. You may not find generics as useful in this course. However, as you start implement practical protocol oriented programming, functional programming, and reactive programming, you will soon discover generics appear quite often.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/subscripts.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/subscripts.html","title":"Subscripts","keywords":"","body":"Subscripts\nIntroduction\nWelcome to lesson 7 of The Swift Fundamentals with Bob. What if I told you that you may create a shortcut? I know it sounds abstract. Let's learn more.\nProblem\nI'd love to have a shortcut instead of calling a method.\nNormal Method\nCreate a class called, HelloKitty which contains a method that returns a string value.\nstruct HelloKitty {\n  func saySomething() -> String {\n    return \"I'm Cute\"\n  }\n}\n\nCreate an instance and call saySomething()\nlet babe = HelloKitty()\nbabe.saySomething()\n\nIntroducing Subscripts\nA subscript provide shortcuts.

However, subscripts can be misleading because there is no name to it. I recommend not to overuse it.\nSwift engineers recommend that, brevity is not the worthwhile goal. Effective communication trumps everything else.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/class-struct-difference.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/class-struct-difference.html","title":"Class vs Struct","keywords":"","body":"Class vs Struct\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 8.

The graph below shows the fundamental difference between value types vs reference types.\n The difference in value type and reference type\nOne Difference in Mutability\nDue to the fundamental difference, there is an interesting discrepancy when it comes to let.\nMutability in Classes\nclass BobClass {\n  var name = \"Bob\"\n}\n\nlet bobClass = BobClass()\nbobClass.name = \"Bobby\"\n\nlet newBobClass = bobClass\n\nnewBobClass.name = \"Bob the Developer\"\nbobClass.name // \"Bob the Developer\"\n\nAlthough the instance, bobClass has been created as a constant, the property of it has been mutated. It is possible because the instance does not own any object, but has a reference to BobClass.\nNo Mutability in Structs\nstruct BobStruct {\n  var name = \"Bob\"\n}\n\nlet bobStruct = BobStruct()\nbobStruct.name\n\nbobStruct.name = \"Bob Lee\"\n// Error: Immutable\n\nIn structs, when an instance is created with a constant, let, it's not possible to mutate its property since the instance has its own copy and the let protects anyone from interfering with its own instance.\nWhen to use Struct/Value Type?\n\n10,000 - 1,000,000 faster than Class\nNo mutability due to no relationship between objects\nWhen subclassing not needed and non-nested structure is recommended\n\nResources\nTo learn more about cons of Object Oriented Programming, you may read the beginning of Intro to Protocol Oriented Programming.

At this point, you might feel as if there is no point of learning the difference. You are right, when you are creating small apps, it doesn't really matter. But, once you start to have a complex structure, that's when you truly see how OOP can be difficult to manage as you've seen the UIKIt diagram.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/set-tuple.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/set-tuple.html","title":"Set and Tuple","keywords":"","body":"Set and Tuple\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 9 of The Swift Fundamentals.

For those who feel confident with OOP, but you want to maximize its potential, you've come to the right place.\nRemember, OOP is at the heart of the iOS ecosystem. You can't go against it. It's like death, shadow, and tax. You can't make apps without using OOP because that's what Apple engineers have designed this platform to be.

In this lesson, you will learn how to become lazy.  In other words, you learn to become smart and effective when it comes to initializing an object. In programming, getting lazy to write less code is in fact good for your teammates and users as long as it's readable. Bill Gates once mentioned, whenever there is hard work to be done, he assigns it to the laziest person as he or she is sure to find an easy way of doing it. So, let's get started.\nProblem\nI'm lazy. Can we initialize quickly?\nCreate Class with Designated Init\nCreate a class called Human\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n }\n\n  // Convenience init intializes the designated init method\n  convenience init() {\n    self.init(name: \"Bob Lee\")\n  }\n}\n\nConvenience init initializes the designated init method by calling self.init.\nCreate Object\nlet lee = Human(name: \"Bob Lee\") // init(name: String)\nlet bob = Human() // Convenience init()\n\nInitialize UIColor\nCreate an instance that stores UIColor.\nimport UIKit\n\nlet randomColor = UIColor(colorLiteralRed: 255/255, green: 80/255, blue: 85/255, alpha: 1)\n\nCustom Convenience Init\nCreate our own convenience init that initializes the designated init by adding extension to UIColor.\nextension UIColor {\n convenience init(r: Float, g: Float, b: Float) {\n   self.init(colorLiteralRed: r/255, green: g/255, blue: b/255, alpha: 1)\n }\n}\n\nlet myFavoriteColor = UIColor(r: 255, g: 80, b: 85)\n\nApplication\n\nUseful for quick initialization for open source projects\nCustom convenience like UIKIt\n\nSource Code\n2001_convenience_init.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to become lazy and effective at the same time. Imagine you are creating a library for your teammates to use. They no longer have to use a designated init method to initialize an object. It's  not necessary. It's a win-win situation. In the next lesson, let's talk about how initialization may fail.\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/computed-property.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/computed-property.html","title":"Computed Property","keywords":"","body":"Computed Property\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 3 of Object Oriented Swift. Today, we are going to learn how to create relationships between variables. So that you don't need to manage two or more variables separately. Are you confused? Well, have you heard, get and set before? Haven't? No worry. I will walk you through by placing your feet on mine. Let's dive into it.\nProblem\nDo we have to make functions all the time to calculate something?\nAtrocious Code\nUnrelated functions that take up many lines. The functions below are used to calculate radius.\nfunc getDiameter(radius: Double) -> Double {\n return radius * 2\n}\nfunc getRadius(diameter: Double) -> Double {\n return diameter / 2\n}\n\ngetDiameter(radius: 10) // return 20\ngetRadius(diameter: 200) // return 100\ngetRadius(diameter: 600) // return 300\n\nIntroducing Computed Property\nYou may create a variable that only can be read. You may not customize. It is also referred to as a gettable property.\n\nComputed = calcualted\n\nGettable Property\nCreate a only readable property.\nclass NumberClass {\n  var readableNumber: Double {\n    get {\n      // Complex logic\n      return 777\n    }\n  }\n  var readableNumbers: Double {\n    return 789\n  }\n}\n\nIf you attempt to modify the property, it will give you an error.\nreadableNumber = 10 // Error\nreadableNumbers = 20 // Error\n\nGettable and Settable Property\nYou may not only make a property gettable, but also settable by inserting set right after get.  Let us create a relationship between radius and diameter.\nvar radius: Double = 10\nvar diameter: Double {\n  get {\n    return radius * 2\n  }\n  set {\n    radius = newValue / 2\n  }  \n}\n\ndiameter = 50\nradius = 100\ndiameter // 200\n\nNow, if you set diameter to 100,  newValue becomes 100. As a result, radius will be 50. If you set radius to 500, diameter will be 1000.\nInstead of calling newValue, you may name the recently set value as you wish. In the example below, there is a relationship between area and side. Instead of calling newValue, I call it as newArea.\nimport Foundation\n\nvar side: Double = 100\nvar area: Double {\n get {\n   return side * side\n }\n set(newArea) {\n   side = sqrt(newArea)\n }\n}\n\narea = 1000\nside // 31.6\n\nApplications\n\nGrabbing and storing data the server\nPropagating relationships between properties\nPreventing others from manipulating your code\n\nSource Code\n2002_computed_property.playground\nConclusion\nIn the beginning of the lesson, you've learned what it means to create a gettable property by calling get or just by returning value. After that, you've also learned how to add set which allows you to modify its value as well as those of other variables. We are going to take a look at how Apple Engineers use computed property to create the iOS ecosystem safe and non-customizable. I know you are super excited to build apps. You will learn how everything fits together in Part 2 and Part 3 of this course.\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/property-observers.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/property-observers.html","title":"Property Observers","keywords":"","body":"Property Observer\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 6 of The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob, Part 1 Object Oriented Programming. You are going to learn how to put a tracker to a property. For example, never mind. Let's just do it.\nProblem\nHow can I add observer/tracker to a property?\nwillSet and didSet\n\nwillSet is called just before the value is set\ndidSet is called immediately after the new value is set.\n\nCreate Step Counter\nCreate a variable called, totalSteps. When the variable encounters a new value, you may notify the user that the value has been changed. In the willSet block, newTotalSteps refers to the new value stored. In the didSet block, oldValue refers to the previous value before totalSteps encounters a new value.\nGrade Tracker\nvar myGrade: Int = 80 {\n  willSet(newGrade) {\n    print(\"About to change your grade to \\(newGrade)\")\n  }\n  didSet {\n    print(\"Your grade has been changed\")\n    print(\"you had \\(oldValue) previously. Now you have \\(myGrade)\")\n  }\n}\n\nmyGrade = 100\n\nStep Counter\nvar totalSteps: Int = 20 {\n  willSet(newTotalSteps) {\n    print(\"About to set totalSteps to \\(newTotalSteps)\")\n  }\n  didSet {\n    if totalSteps > oldValue  {\n      print(\"Added \\(totalSteps - oldValue) steps\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ntotalSteps = 60\n\nApplication\nYou may notify the user or change background color once the user successfully logs in to the apps.\nvar userLoginInfo: Bool = false {\n  willSet(newValue) {\n    print(\"The user has tried something\")\n  }\n  didSet {\n    if userLoginInfo {\n      print(\"The user has switched from \\(oldValue) to \\(userLoginInfo)\")\n      // Backgroud color\n      // Animation\n      // Pop Up\n      // All kinds of stuff\n  }\n }\n}\n\nuserLoginInfo = true\n// The user has tried something\n// The user has switched from false to true\nuserLoginInfo = true\n// The user has tried something\n// The user has switched from true to true\n\nSimilarity with Computed Property\n\nAlways recalculated\n\nWhat makes Property Observers different\n\nThere is a default value and it is observed rather than calculated.\nwillSet and didSet will not get called when you initialize it.\n\nSource Code\n2003_property_observers.playground\nConclusion\nGreat! The whole purpose of using property observer is to write less code but provide greater readability. You don't have to create a function with a switch or else-if statement. As you've seen there are ways ways to check whether user has been logged or not, computed property for me works great because it provides a separate block of code with distinct keywords such as didSet and willSet.\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/failable-init.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/failable-init.html","title":"Failable Init","keywords":"","body":"Failable Init\nIntroduction\nIn this lesson you are going learn how to design an init method that, first, possibly returns no object, but nil, second, even throws an error using error handling we talked about in Chapter 1.  \nProblem\nCan initialization fail?\nError Handling (Review)\nenum NameError: Error {\n  case noName\n}\n\nstruct UdemyCourse {\n  let courseName: String\n\n  init(name: String) throws {\n    if name.isEmpty {\n      throw NameError.noName\n    }\n    self.courseName = name\n  }\n}\n\ndo {\n  let myCourse = try UdemyCourse(name: \"Bob\")\n  myCourse.courseName\n\n} catch NameError.noName {\n  print(\"Bob, please enter the name\")\n}\n\nDesign Failable Init\nInsert ? right after init.

There are a lot of examples, so let's get started.\nProblem\nProblem: Super... Super.init?\nUIViewController\nYou might have seen something like this below. Many wonder what super and override stand for. Let us find out.\nimport UIKit\n\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {\n  // viewDidLoad() is built-in and it runs automatically\n  override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    print(\"Hello\")\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Vehicle Class\nCreate a class called Vehicle. It contains one gettable property and one method.\nclass Vehicle {\n  var description: String {\n    return \"Hello, I'm moving at 30km/hr\"\n  }\n\n  func warning() {\n    print(\"Be careful, I'm going pretty fast\")\n  }\n}\n\nOverride Method and Property\nclass ToyCar: Vehicle {\n  override var description: String {\n    return \"\\(super.description) hey, I'm a cute car\"\n  }\n\n  override func warning() {\n    print(\"hello, don't mind me\")\n    super.warning()\n  }\n}\n\nlet myFutureCar = ToyCar()\nmyFutureCar.description\nmyFutureCar.warning()\n\nYou may customize inherited properties and methods by inserting override.  You may access inherited properties and methods by calling super.\nclass ToyCar: Vehicle {\n\n let price = \"$100\"\n\n override var description: String {\n   return \"\\(super.description), I'm \\(price)\"\n }\n\n override func warning() {\n   super.warning() // \"Be careful, I'm going pretty fast\"\n   print(\"Let me just tell you, I'm not dangerous much\")\n }\n}\n\nSubclass Object\nCreate an object to check if the methods and properties have been overridden in the subclass,ToyCar.\nlet myFutureCar = ToyCar()\n\nmyFutureCar.description\n// \"Hello, I'm moving at 30km/hr, I'm a cute car\"\nmyFutureCar.warning()\n// \"hello, dont' mind me\"\n// \"Be careful, I'm going pretty fast\"\n\nSuper Init\nYou may override init from super class. However, the number one rule is: you must put associated value to every property even from the super class.\nDesign Super Class\nCreate a class that contain one property called, origin.\nclass Human {\n var origin: String\n\n init(enterOrgin: String) {\n   origin = enterOrgin\n }\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\nCreate a subclass, called Korean that inherits from Human. The Korean class contains a property called, name.  However, when you initialize, you must initialize the origin property from the Human class by calling super.init.\nclass Korean: Human {\n  let city: String\n\n  init(enterCity: String) {\n    self.city = enterCity\n    super.init(enterOrgin: \"Korean\")\n  }\n\n  init(enterCity: String, origin: String) {\n    self.city = enterCity\n    super.init(enterOrgin: origin)\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Object\nThere are two init methods in the Korean class. You may choose any since both initialize the origin property from the Human class.\nlet bob = Korean(enterName: \"Bob the Dev\")\nlet bobby = Korean(enterName: \"Bob the Dev\", myOrigin: \"Korean\")\n\nOverride Init\nSimilar to how you may override a method and property, you may include additional lines of code by overriding the init method.\nDesign Base Class\nDesign a class called, Tesla. It contains a property called, numberOfWheels.\nclass Tesla {\n  var numberOfWheels: Int\n\n  init(enterWheelNumber: Int) {\n    numberOfWheels = enterWheelNumber\n  }\n}\n\nclass ModelS: Tesla {\n  override init(enterWheelNumber: Int) {\n    super.init(enterWheelNumber: enterWheelNumber)\n    print(\"Wow, you've got a nice car\")\n  }\n}\n\nModelS(enterWheelNumber: 50) // Wow, you've got a nice car\n\nSource Code\n2005_override_init_method_property.playground\nConclusion\nNow, you understand what goes under when you see or type phrases such as super.init, super.viewDidLoad, and override.

At the end of this lesson, you will learn how NASA could have saved millions of dollars if they used the feature Swift offers.\nProblem\nHow can one init init the other?\nDesign Rocket Ship\nDesign a struct called NuclearRocket. There are two init methods and two properties: meters and liters.\nstruct NuclearRocket {\n  var meters: Double\n  var liters: Double\n\n  // Init for &#x1F1F0;&#x1F1F7;\n  init(meters: Double, liters: Double) {\n    self.meters = meters\n    self.liters = liters\n  }\n\n  // Init for &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8;\n  init(ft: Double, gallons: Double) {\n    let convertedMeters = ft / 3.28\n    let convertedLiters = gallons * 3.79\n    self.init(meters: convertedMeters, liters: convertedLiters)\n  }\n}\n\nUsing the second init method, you may initialize the properties using ft and gallon because it calls the first init method by calling self.init. This is analogous to convenience init.\nCreate Object\nFor Korean scientists\nvar rocket = NuclearRocket(meters: 20, liters: 20)\nrocket.liters // 20\nrocket.meters // 20\n\nFor American scientists\nvar newRocket = NuclearRocket(ft: 300, gallons: 2)\nnewRocket.liters // 7.56\nnewRocket.meters // 91.4\n\nSource Code\n2006_two_phase_init.playground\nConclusion\nGreat, to be honest, I haven't used two phase init in my previous apps before.

The Mars Climate robot launched by NASA in 1998 to study the Mars.  However, a year later,  communication with the spacecraft was lost as the spacecraft, due to ground-based computer software which produced output in non-SI units of pound instead of the SI units of newton. $327.6 million gone. The two phase init could have been useful.\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/type-property-method.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/type-property-method.html","title":"Type Property and Method","keywords":"","body":"Type Property\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 7, the last lesson of The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob, Part 1 Object Oriented Programming. Today, you are going to learn one of the most confusing topics when it comes to Object Oriented Programming. It's type methods and properties. If you aren't familiar with those, don't you worry. Right now, you may feel confused, but you will come out strong, confident, and pumped. You will be excited to apply what you will learn today in your code later. Enough of talking. Let's go!\nProblem\nI don't know when to use static, final, class. What are those?\nStatic Property and Method\nAnything that has static in front will not be overridden. In fact, static is the only type property and method used within struct since it does not provide inheritance.\nstruct SomeStructure {\n  static var storedTypeProperty = \"Some value.\"\n  static var computedProperty: Int {\n    get {\n      return 120\n    }\n    set {\n      print(\"You've set to \\(newValue)\")\n    }\n  }\n  static func hello() {\n    print(\"hello\")\n  }\n}\n\nAccess properties and methods\nSomeStructure.storedTypeProperty // \"Some Value\"\nSomeStructure.hello() // 'hello\"'\n\nClass\nUnlike static, class is only used within Classes. But, Classes also support static. class properties and types may be overridden.\nDesign Class\nCreate a class called GrandParent. It contains one static property and one static method. It also contains a normal method and another method with final attached.\nclass GrandParent {\n  static var numberOfYearsInMarriage = 30\n  static func introduce() {\n    print(\"We've been married for \\(numberOfYearsInMarriage)\")\n }\n\n  class func introducing() {\n    print(\"We've been married for \\(numberOfYearsInMarriage)\")\n  }\n\n  final func cantOverride() {\n    print(\"you can't change me\")\n  }\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\nNow, create Parent class that inherits GrandParent.  You may override func sayHi(), but you may not override final func sayHello(). final prevents Classes from overriding. It's similar to static.\nclass Parent: GrandParent {\n  override class func introducing() {\n    print(\"I'm married for 5 years\")\n  }\n//  override static func introduce() {\n//    print(\"I'm married for 5 years\")\n//  }\n}\n\nParent.introducing() // \"I'm married for 5 years\"\n\nPractical Usage\nYou may store a list of items using the follow way below.\nclass BluetoothID {\n struct iPhone {\n   static let iPhone4 = \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\n   static let iPhone5 = \"7867-5676-4535-1235\"\n   static let iPhone6 = \"3938-6738-1424-9876\"\n   static let iPhone7 = \"4845-3148-1237-1296\"\n   static let iPhone8 = \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n }\n}\n\nBluetoothID.iPhone.iPhone8 // \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\nBluetoothID.iPhone.iPhone8 // \"\"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n\nYou may also use enum. but I prefer the method above since I do n't have to call rawValue.\nAlternative\nenum AirDropID: String {\n case iPhone4 = \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\n case iPhone5 = \"7867-5676-4535-1235\"\n case iPhone6 = \"3938-6738-1424-9876\"\n case iPhone7 = \"4845-3148-1237-1296\"\n case iPhone8 = \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n}\n\nAirDropID.iPhone8.rawValue // \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n\nResources\nSource Code\n2007_type_property.playground\nConclusion\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/singleton-pattern.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/singleton-pattern.html","title":"Singleton Pattern","keywords":"","body":"Singleton Pattern\nIntroduction\n\nA singleton is an object which is instantiated exactly once.\n\nclass AccountManager {\n  static let sharedInstance = AccountManager()\n\n  var userInfo = (ID: \"bobthedev\", Password: 01036343984)\n\n  // Networking: communicating server\n  func network() {\n    // get everything\n  }\n\n  private init() { }\n}\n\nAccountManager.sharedInstance.userInfo\n// (ID \"bobthedev\", Password 01036343984)\n\n// ViewController One\nAccountManager.sharedInstance.userInfo.ID // \"bobthedev\"\n\n// ViewController Two\nAccountManager.sharedInstance.userInfo.ID = \"bobleesj\"\n\n// ViewController Three\nAccountManager.sharedInstance.userInfo.ID // \"bobleesj\n\n\nExample UIApplication, UserDefault, NSNotification.\n\nSource Code\n2008_singleton_pattern.playground\nReference\nConclusion\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/conclusion.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/conclusion.html","title":"Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"Conclusion\nYou've completed Chapter 2 Advanced Object Oriented Programming with me.

You've probably heard or used closures before. So, let me as you this, do you know what completion handlers are used for? If you do, do you know how to build one? Do you know what a trailing closure is and when to use it? If you weren't able to confidently answer to these questions, you've come to the right place. A lot of books and courses do not cover the fundamentals and expects new developers to use them. It's analogous to not knowing what super.viewDidLoad is but you just use it because it somehow works. There are of completion handlers used. You've seen before because it is used for networking, going to the next View Controller, animation, and so on. We don't want that to happen. Again, we do not question why it works. We question why it is that way.\n\nClosures vs Functions\nClosures vs Functions (Part 2)\nLazy Initialization\nCapture list in Closure\nTrailing Closures\nCompletion Handlers and Callback\n@escape and @autoclosure\n\n"},"course/functional-swift/intro-closure-part1.html":{"url":"course/functional-swift/intro-closure-part1.html","title":"Intro to Closures Part 1","keywords":"","body":"Closures vs Functions\nIntroduction\nWhen I learned Swift as my firsts programming language, I had a really hard time understanding closures. I avoided it as much as possible, and I didn't know why we use it in the first place. It took me good 3 months to completely understand Closures. So, I don't expect you to be comfortable with closures taking by taking a couple of lessons. It is hard, and you just have to admit it. It's riding a bicycle for the first time. You just have to fall and feel uncomfortable until you get used it. It's like seeing a mathematical formula you've never seen before. You just have to get used it. Enough said, let's find out how closures is different from normal functions. Brace yourself.\nProblem\nWho are you closures, () -> ()?\nDefinition\n\nA closure is a function without name and the func keyword (for now).\nQuick and easy to carry around as a variable/constant or just pass as a parameter\n\nFunctions\nCreate a function that add two numbers.\nfunc addTwoNumbers(number1: Int, number2: Int) -> Int {\n  return number1 + number2\n}\n\nFirst Class Citizen\nYou may store a function into a variable/constant.\nvar addFunction = addTwoNumbers\naddFunction(10, 30) // 40\n\nIntroducing Closures\nStore closures into a variable. A closure begins with {. In order to store into a variable/constant, you must specify its type.\nvar addClosures: (Int, Int) -> Int = {\n  (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  return number1 + number2\n}\n\naddClosures(4, 10) // 14\n\nShort Form\nYou may not enter return after in if only if you enter the value that the closure expects to return.\nvar addClosuresTwo = {\n  (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  return number1 + number2\n}\n\nvar addClosuresThree = {\n  (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  number1 + number2\n}\n\naddClosuresThree(4, 6)\n\nShortest Form\nAs long as you specify the type, you may not create an argument label. You may just insert $0 or $1.\nvar addClosuresFour: (Int, Int) -> Int = { $0 + $1 }\n\naddClosuresFour(4, 5) // 9\n\nOne example with () -> String\nfunc callString() -> String {\n  return \"hello, I'm a function\"\n}\n\nlet callStringWtihClosure: () -> String = { () in\n  print(\"hello\")\n  return \"hello, I'm a closure\"\n}\n\ncallStringWtihClosure()\n// \"hello, I'm a closure\"\n\nlet callStringWtihClosureTwo: () -> String = { () in\n  \"hello, I'm a closure\"\n}\n\nlet callStringWtihClosureThree: () -> String = { \"hello, I'm a closure\" }\nlet callStringWtihClosureFour = { \"hello, I'm a closure\" }\ncallStringWtihClosureFour // () -> String\n\nResource\nIf you are not familiar with closures, you have to get used to it. Again, it took me ages to a couple weeks to get used to it. You must understand. Keep googling on your own.\nNo Fear Closure in Swift 3 with Bob\nSource Code\n3001_intro_closures_part1.playground\nConclusion\nDo you feel uncomfortable or confused? That's okay. It's just a part of the process of acquiring knowledge. You struggle to learn because it indicates that you are not in your comfort zone. Learning is done by your. So, if you need to, refer to my resources, and google until you figure out what's going on. Don't give up. I hope you are able to distinguish the difference between a function and variable. Remember you can store a function into a variable and carry it around. Also, when you make a closure, you must indicate its type. You've learned how to write a closure statement using longer as well as shorter syntax by putting dollar signs and eliminating in and return. In the next lesson, you will find out how to pass closure as a parameter in a function.\n"},"course/functional-swift/intro-closure-part2.html":{"url":"course/functional-swift/intro-closure-part2.html","title":"Intro to Closures Part 2","keywords":"","body":"Closures vs Functions (Part 2)\nIntroduction\nIn the previous lesson, you've learned how to create a closure.

Not only it was located at the end of the Swift documentation, but it just felt really foreign to me. It sounded scary. Of course, it feels natural to use it, so I understand if you are not comfortable with it. I just would like to tell you that you might have to watch this video multiple times to get by. You might have to read 10 more articles for you to fully get comfortable. I really expect you guys to be proactive when you are confused. I will do my part which is to explain in the most clear way possible. Well, let's get started from the bottom with me. Let's go!\nProblem\nProblem: Protocols, who are you?\n\nProtocol is like a basketball coach. He/she tells players what to do, but he/she doesn't know how to dunk.\n\nDrawbacks of OOP\n\nWhen you subclass, you have to inherit properties and methods which you may not need. Your object becomes unnecessarily bloated.\nWhen you make a lot of super classes, it becomes extremely hard to navigate between each class and fix bugs/edit.\nSince objects are referencing to the same place in memory, if you make a copy and create a small change its property, it can mess up the rest. (Mutability due to reference)\n\nDesign Protocol\nCreate a protocol called, Humanable. It contains two properties and one method. Do not worry about get and set for now.\nprotocol Humanable {\n  var name: String { get set }\n  var race: String { get }\n  func sayHi()\n}\n\nCreate a class that conforms to Korea just like how you would subclass. To prevent Swift from screaming, you must implement two properties and one method defined in the protocol.\nstruct Korean: Humanable {\n  var name: String = \"Bob Lee\"\n  var race: String = \"Asian\"\n  func sayHi() {\n    print(\"Hi, I'm \\(name)\")\n  }\n}\n\nclass American: Humanable {\n  var name: String = \"Joe Smith\"\n  var race: String = \"White\"\n  func sayHi() {\n    print(\"Hi, I'm \\(name)\")\n  }\n}\n\nProtocol Inheritance\nprotocol SuperHumanable: Humanable {\n  var canFly: Bool { get set }\n  func punch()\n}\n\nstruct BobtheDeveloper: SuperHumanable {\n  var name: String = \"Bob\"\n  var race: String = \"Asian\"\n  func sayHi() {\n    print(\"I code\")\n  }\n\n  var canFly: Bool = false\n  func punch() {\n    print(\"I don't punch\")\n  }\n}\n\n\n{ get } or { get set} only apply to computed property. If you are defining a stored property, you may choose either { get } or { get set }.\n\nComputed Property\nCreate a protocol called, Breathable. It contains two properties: isBreathing and isLiving.\nprotocol Breathable {\n  var isBreating: Bool { get set }\n  var isLiving: Bool { get }\n}\n\nCreate a struct that conforms to Breathable. The struct contains properties: isBreathing and isLiving. Define them as computed properties rather than stored.\nstruct Human: Breathable {\n  var isBreating: Bool {\n    get { return true }\n    set {}\n  }\n\n  var isLiving: Bool {\n    get { return true }\n    set {}\n  }\n}\n\n\nRule: If you are using a computer property, if it is { get } you may make a property gettable or settable. If it is defined as { get set } within a protocol, you must make it gettable and settable.\n\n\n\n\n{ get }\n{ get set }\n\n\n\n\nStored Property &#x1F600;\nComputed Property --> Gettable, Settable (Optional)\n\n\nStored Property &#x1F600;\nComputed Property --> Gettable, Settable (Must)\n\n\n\nResources\nReference\nhttps://krakendev.io/blog/subclassing-can-suck-and-heres-why\nhttps://content.pivotal.io/blog/all-evidence-points-to-oop-being-bullshit\nSource Code\n4001_intro_protocols.playground\nConclusion\nAre you wrapping your heads around? Again, make sure you remember a couple rules. If you use { get } or { get set }. You can both use it as a stored property and change the value as you wish. However, if you identify a property with { get set } please remember if you use computed property, you have to make it settable as well. For { get }, you can do whatever you want. In our next lesson, you are going to see some of practical aspects of Protocol. You've only seen the tip of an ice berg. Let's get started my friend.

Today, you learn the most important concept. It is not technically about protocol oriented programming. You use Protocol, but you will learn how to pass data between two classes using it. There are a lot of bullshit tutorials out there. You've come to the right place. Let me tell you the majority of people don't understand what's going on, and they simply copy off from the screen. Have you ever seen, tableView.delegate = self? What the heck is that?\nProblem\nPass Data between Classes\n\nYou just have to memorize it. It's a gift from Apple engineers. Take it. Do not question why it works. But, find out why it is useful.You might have to watch this video multiple times\n\nDesign Protocol\nCreate a protocol called, PassDataDelegate. It contains a method that takes data whose type is in String and returns String.\nprotocol PassDataDelegate {\n  func passData(data: String) -> String\n}\n\nDesign Delegator (Sender)\nCreate a class that contains an optional property whose type is PassDataDelegate?.\nclass FirstVC {\n  var delegate: PassDataDelegate?\n}\n\nIf you call the method, passData associated with the property, delegate, it will return nil since you have not initialized delegate.\nFirstVC().delegate?.passData(data: \"Bob\") // nil\n\nDesign Delegate (Receiver)\nCreate ClassTwo that conforms to PassDataDelegate.

For those who are confused, you might have to watch this video 5-10 times to get used to it. You might have to search up on Google and learn more. You might have to playaround. If you are confused by my lesson and you are not getting it, it's your fault. It took me 2 weeks to understand delegate. It's not easy. But, you just have to struggle when you are not in the comfort zone.

I'm going to repeat myself. If you are not comfortable with any of these concepts we've learned in POP, don't dare jumping to Part 2. If you do, you are a loser. You don't like challenges. You give up. Again, don't again go to Part 2 if you don't understand any of these concepts. Check all the resources and check all the google results. Practice, and get comfortable. It's not about building apps. You just simply download from Github, and claim that it is yours. You have to understand what's really going on. You know, I've been always straight up telling the truth if you've ever read any of my articles in terms opinions.\nThe only way for you to learn something, is through struggling, and if you are getting confused at all, you are challenging yourself. So, keep learning. Keep visualizing. Keep imaging instead of consuming only. I've attached resources for you to to become a better iOS or Swfit developer. Check those out. You will be surprised how many people commented on the bottom saying they didn't know. But, we've covered everything except functional programming. Again, if you want to get updates for the upcoming course with RxSwift and Functional Programming with MVVM, send me an email to register. If you are learning with me, I don't have sell you too much.

Entities such as methods and properties are declared only once but used repeatedly. Design APIs to make those uses clear and concise. When evaluating a design, reading a declaration is seldom sufficient; always examine a use case to make sure it looks clear in context.\nClarity is more important than brevity. Although Swift code can be compact, it is a non-goal to enable the smallest possible code with the fewest characters. Brevity in Swift code, where it occurs, is a side-effect of the strong type system and features that naturally reduce boilerplate.\nWrite a documentation comment for every declaration. Insights gained by writing documentation can have a profound impact on your design, so don’t put it off.\nPromote Clear Usage\nInclude all the words needed to avoid ambiguity for a person reading code where the name is used.\nextension List {\n  public mutating func remove(at position: Index) -> Element\n}\nemployees.remove(at: x)\n\nemployees.remove(x) // unclear: are we removing x?\n\nOmit needless words\nIn particular, omit words that merely repeat type information.\npublic mutating func removeElement(_ member: Element) -> Element?\nallViews.removeElement(cancelButton)\n\npublic mutating func remove(_ member: Element) -> Element?\n\nallViews.remove(cancelButton) // clearer\n\nName variables, parameters, and associated types according to their roles, rather than their type constraints.\nvar string = \"Hello\"\nprotocol ViewController {\n  associatedtype ViewType : View\n}\nclass ProductionLine {\n  func restock(from widgetFactory: WidgetFactory)\n}\n\nvar greeting = \"Hello\"\nprotocol ViewController {\n  associatedtype ContentView : View\n}\nclass ProductionLine {\n  func restock(from supplier: WidgetFactory)\n}\n\nCompensate for weak type information to clarify a parameter’s role.\nfunc add(_ observer: NSObject, for keyPath: String)\n\ngrid.add(self, for: graphics) // vague\n\nfunc addObserver(_ observer: NSObject, forKeyPath path: String)\ngrid.addObserver(self, forKeyPath: graphics) // clear\n\nStrive for Fluent Usage\n Prefer method and function names that make use sites form grammatical English phrases.\n x.insert(y, at: z)          “x, insert y at z”\nx.subViews(havingColor: y)  “x's subviews having color y”\nx.capitalizingNouns()       “x, capitalizing nouns”\n\nx.insert(y, position: z)\nx.subViews(color: y)\nx.nounCapitalize()\n\n\nIt is acceptable for fluency to degrade after the first argument or two when those arguments are not central to the call’s meaning:\n\nBegin names of factory methods with “make”, e.g. x.makeIterator()\nlet foreground = Color(red: 32, green: 64, blue: 128)\nlet newPart = factory.makeWidget(gears: 42, spindles: 14)\n\nlet foreground = Color(havingRGBValuesRed: 32, green: 64, andBlue: 128)\nlet newPart = factory.makeWidget(havingGearCount: 42, andSpindleCount: 14)\n\nName functions and methods according to their side-effects\n// Those without side-effects should read as noun phrases, e.g. x.distance(to: y), i.successor().\n\n// Those with side-effects should read as imperative verb phrases, e.g., print(x), x.sort(), x.append(y).\n\nimperative for the mutating method and apply the “ed” or “ing” suffix to name its nonmutating counterpart.\nWhen adding “ed” is not grammatical because the verb has a direct object, name the nonmutating variant using the verb’s present participle, by appending “ing.”\n\n\n\nMutating\nNon-Mutating\n\n\n\n\nx.sort()\nz = x.sorted()\n\n\nx.append(y)\nz = x.appending(y)\n\n\n\nTry to use Struct over Classes\nIf you need extra features, use protocol extension\nFactory Method\nCamel Case\n Start with Uppercase for Protocol, Class, Types, Enum and lowercase for everything else\nType\nTry not ot use NS.\nType Casting\nbob as[String] // &#x1F645;‍\nbob as [String] // &#x1F646;‍\n\nType Inference\nlet selector = #selector(viewDidLoad)\nview.backgroundColor = .red\nlet toView = context.view(forKey: .to)\nlet view = UIView(frame: .zero)\n\nlet selector = #selector(ViewController.viewDidLoad)\nview.backgroundColor = UIColor.red\nlet toView = context.view(forKey: UITransitionContextViewKey.to)\nlet view = UIView(frame: CGRect.zero)\n\nNS Type\nAvoid it\nProtocol\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {\n  // class stuff here\n}\n\n// MARK: -

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\nAvoid inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic binding and other complicated OOP concepts. Use delegation and simple if-constructs instead.\nUse simple brute-force solutions first instead of complicated algorithms. Slower algorithms will work in the first place.\nFor slightly unrelated but rather small pieces of functionality use private methods instead of an additional class.\nYAGNI\nAvoid Creating a YAGNI (You aren’t going to need it) - You should try not to add functionality until you need it.\nLaw of Demeter\nThe Law of Demeter (LoD) or principle of least knowledge is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs.\n\nEach unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units \"closely\" related to the current unit.\nEach unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers. Only talk to your immediate friends.\n\nElaboration\nAny section of code (code block, function, class, etc) should minimize the dependencies on other areas of code. This is achieved by using shared variables as little as possible. Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured computer system and a good design, and when combined with high cohesion, supports the general goals of high readability and maintainability.\nEliminate, minimize, and reduce complexity of necessary relationships.\nBy hiding implementation details, coupling is reduced.\nHide Implementation Detail\nHiding implementation details allows change to the implementation of a code component while minimally affecting any other modules that use that component.\nA software module hides information (i.e. implementation details) by providing an interface, and not leak any unnecessary information.\nYou may follow a couple principles:\n\nMinimize accessibility of classes and members.\nDon’t expose member data in public.\nAvoid putting private implementation details into a class’s interface.\nDecrease coupling to hide more implementation details.\n\n\n\nBoy-Scout Rule\n\"Leave the campground cleaner than you found it”.
