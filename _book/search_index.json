Swift with Bob\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nAs a developer whose first programming language is Swift, I've taken online courses from major platforms. However, I have been frustrated by a lack of detailed explanation from instructors. They tend to focus on final products, thus missing out the fundamentals. I was confused by which design principles to follow, and why. Soon after I've been blogging for the last 5 months, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine. I've received hundreds of emails and questions regarding how to write code that does not violate principles such as DRY, modularity, and readability. As a result, I've decided to create this course dedicated for my younger self. I believe it all comes down to the fundamentals which I lacked in the beginning.\nReference\nThis is a platform for my students to download the source code, lecture notes, and scripts. As a life-long student, I've always wanted to have a complete overview of what I've learned. Most instructors avoid documenting since it takes effort besides making videos alone. I chose the road less traveled to help my students and differentiate myself from the competitive marketplace.\n\nUntil the course get officially released, please consider it as a rough draft.\n\nPersonal Motivation\nI feel grateful for what learning offers in my life. It would have been impossible for me to create this course and communicate in English. I've decided to devote my career providing affordable education channels for all people globally. As a person who has lived in third world countries and also attended college in NYC, I understand, education is the way for anyone rise up and increase a standard of living and quality of life.

This monitor doesn't require a power cord. It only needs a USB port. It's useful for client meetings as well.\nMonitor\n\n\nAcer 23.8 Inch Monitor\nIt's affordable, and I use it to record tutorials and any other activities.  An extra monitor is a must for anyone who is serious about programming.\nMonitor\n\n\nApple's Magic Keyboard\nIt prevents a neck-strain because I no longer have to turn my next to see the side monitor. There is no delay time between input and output. Also, there is a rechargeable battery so I get to save time.\nKeyboard\n\n\nApple's Magic Mouse 2\nIt looks aesthetic, and I love the fact that it is so thin that I can carry it in my pocket otherwise I had to carry a small bag. Similar to the keyboard above, it doesn't require any extra battery cells, so there is no recurring fee or time spent on going to the supermarket.\nMouse\n\n\n2013 MacBook Pro 15 Inch\nI don't think I have to explain. The link provides the cheapest offer for now. It is around $800 which is pretty good deal considering I can probably use it for another 3 year. So, you'd only pay like $250 per year which is affordable.\nLaptop\n\n\n\n\nThe cheaper ones are refurbished. I'd recommend you to get a new one since it just feels better and you are going to use them for another 2-3 years. If you spot anything cheaper, make sure it is not the first generation. The second generation contains rechargeable battery: Magic Keyboard 2(MLA22LL) and Magic Mouse 2(MLA02LL)\n\nBlogging and Course Production\n\n\n\nGadget\nMy Usage\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nCanon EOS 700D\nI've noticed an iPhone 7 Plus just can't beat the depth that the DSLR camera offers. I use my camera to record all of my introduction and conclusion videos. It's affordable and great for those who want to get started and make videos.\nCamera\n\n\nBluetooth Selfie Stick\nInstead of extending my arm, I like to use it to show background and take pictures with my friends.\nCamera Tool\n\n\nToshiba 1TB Portable Hard Drive\nI can't store everything on my mac. So, this is just great even as a backup as well. If you are serious about making online courses or you have a lot images, it's just a must.\nStorage\n\n\nSamsung 64GB SD Card\nI used to record videos with a normal SD card but its writing speed was so slow that the recording stopped after a couple seconds. I had no issue with the SD card.\nStorage\n\n\nBlue Snowball USB Microphone\nAll of my YouTube tutorials and Udemy course videos are recorded with this microphone. I love it. Since I've lost its stand, I've been using a pizza box as you can see in my recent videos.\nMicrophone\n\n\nSony Camera Microphone\nI use it along with my camera since the Blue Snow Microphone is too big to carry it all the time.\nMicrophone\n\n\n\nProductive Home Office\nCurrently, I work at home and having the right work environment allows me to stay focused and spend less than on doing tasks that don't add much value to my production. Unlike the iOS Development Tools mentioned above, these are non-tech related gadgets that I crave.\n\n\n\nGadget\nWhy I Would Get\nCategory\n\n\n\n\n3-Piece Corner Desk\nI just need a long desk. I care about how things look because the environment influence my mind subconsciously. It's affordable as well.\nDesk\n\n\nLeather Chair\nSimilar to the phone stand and the desk, it just looks visually appealing. I tend to grab products that look good because I feel good.\nChair\n\n\niPhone Stand\nNot only it is visually aesthetic, but also it allows me to use my app instantly because I don't even need to grab, but just scroll with my finger comfortably.\nPhone Stand\n\n\nPhone Ring Stand\nI think it's just a must because it allows me to watch YouTube videos while eating food and right before I go to bed.\nStand\n\n\nSilver Laptop Stand\nIf I use a double monitor, it's essential for me to get a laptop stand  so that my next does not have to move up and down and stay align with the height of the monitor. It puts less stress. Also, the color matches with the laptop so it looks aesthetic.\nLaptop Stand\n\n\n\nWish List\n\n\n\nGadget\nWhy I wish\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nMacBook Pro 15.4-inch with Touch Bar\nI just want to take my laptop to the next level. I've been using my laptop but I just want it a little bit better so that I can render videos faster\nComputer\n\n\nSamsung 27-Inch Curved Monitor\nI have a descent monitor, but again, I've never had curved one before. So, I just want to try it out\nMonitor\n\n\nApple Airpods\nCurrently, I use Samsung's bluetooth earphone, but Airpods is just classy. I got hooked by Apple's video.\nHeadphones\n\n\nC Shape 4-in-1 Stabilizer\nAlthough I'm not a film maker, I'd love to watch one of these when I travel during summer breaks.\nCamera\n\n\n\n\nI'm going to buy these whenever I have a chance. These are just amazing.\n\nTravel\nI travel quite often because my family has been living in different parts of the world. Therefore, I always carry these products below so that I can stay productive even if I travel.\n\n\n\nTravel\nUsage\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nXiaomi 10000mAH\nI carry it everywhere because I blog and make tutorials with my phone. I also do a lot of social media and communication with my phone. It is indispensable.\nCharger\n\n\nTravel Universal Adapter Charger\nI hate wires and chargers because they take up a lot of space and wires cause massive headaches. But, the universal charger takes care of all the hassle for me\nCharger\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware \nHosting and Cloud Computing\n\n\n\nSaaS\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nDigital Ocean\nI use it to run virtual servers. It's more affordable than Google's\n\n\nBluehost\nI use it to host my website and purchase my domain name\n\n\n\nFinance\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nTransferWise\nIt disrupts the way banks send money. It's decentralized so the international wire transfer occurs within a day or two and it's cheap if you are dealing with money less than $10,000. Get started with sending £500 for free with the link\n\n\nQuickbooks\nIt creates invoice, track all my expenses, employee payrolls. It helps me prepare for my upcoming tax returns.\n\n\n\nSchedule & Events\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nCalendly\nThis is my favorite scheduling tool. You don't need to buy a premium account. It's free to use. It allows you to set date and time blocks when you are available, when you send your profile link to someone else, the person can choose the time based on their time zone. I use it all the time for scheduling. You can see my schedule here.  \n\n\nTito\nI've used Evenbrite to organize and schedule events. But, Tito provides a seamless experience for me. The landing page looks great. I recently purchased a ticket for the upcoming Swift conference.\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nGitbook\nI'm currently using Gitbook to document. It allows me to allow Markdown seamlessly with my favorite Text Editor and Github. If you want to get started, feel free to watch this tutorial. I also use it to share my lecture notes for The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\n\nTemplate\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nJupiter Wordpress Theme\nI recently bought this theme to create my own personal website without having to write a single line of code because it provides pre-made and highly customizable drag and drop elements. You can find out what you could possibly create this theme here.\n\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\nApps\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nInbox by Gmail\nI love using this app instead of relying on iPhone's default mail or Gmail. The app automatically organizes items into separate groups through machine learning, and I may archive or read the entire group with a single swipe. As a person who receives a number of comments on social media, this app is just perfect for me\n\n\nDiscord\nAlthough Slack is okay, I use Discord because it's free for unlimited users. It's loved by gamers since it provides channels for voice calls. But, it also provides syntax and markdown highlighting. In fact, I have a group for my students to interact with each other.\n\n\n\nFeedback and Survey\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nTypeform\nI used to use Google Form, but Type form looks a little more engaging because it provides interactive experience and you can also add payment\n\n\n\nVideo Editing\nAdobe Premier Pro and Aftereffect\nProject Management\n\n\n\nPlatform\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nWrike\nWrike is an ideal project management solution for teams and businesses of all sizes: from solopreneurs and small startups to Fortune 500 firms.\n\n\nTrello\nTrello provides an overview. I use it to organize my weekly work.\n\n\n\n \n \nBooks \nI read 80-100 books a year. Although I'm 20, books allow me to gain insights and allow me to process any situation.\nSoftware Development\nAlthough I spend a majority of time learning iOS, I also attempt to learn design patterns, interview questions, and algorithms so that I can stay on top of the game.\n\n\n\nBook\nAuthor\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nCracking the Code Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions\nGayle McDowell\nAlgorithm & Data Structure\n\n\niOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide\nChristian Keur\niOS Development\n\n\n\nStartup\nAlthough my first startup failed, I incorporated and grew the team with close to a dozen employees. The books below are the one I've read and learned so much from these resources that allowed me build a great community and blog.\n\n\n\nBook\nAuthor\nWhat I've Learned\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nExponential Organizations: Why new organizations are ten times better, faster, and cheaper than yours\nSalim Ismail\nWhat it takes to create a scalable startup with two acronyms: IDEAS and SCALE\nStrategy\n\n\nHooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products\nNir Eyal\nElements that lead us to use Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and so on.\nStrategy\n\n\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution\nKlaus Schwab\nNew rising technology that would disrupt governments and our lives\nFuture\n\n\nThe Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses\nEric Ries\nHow to test the market before investing a lot of money\nStrategy\n\n\n#AskGaryVee: One Entrepreneur's Take on Leadership, Social Media, and Self-Awareness\nGary Vayerchuck\nHe is the one who tought me everything about building community and focus on long-term relationships over short-term sales.

However, don't let its readability and hype fool you. It's a complex language inspired by many programming languages out there. In fact, you will suffer, and I want it that way. Let me explain.\nEmbrace Struggle\nConsuming knowledge goes against the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics that things in nature want to remain scattered. What we do everyday defies the law. It's organic to struggle. It doesn’t mean struggles can't be fun. Perhaps, people attempt to climb the highest mountain and try to hold breath in icy water despite death threat. Struggles produce stories filled with hardships. They allow us to appreciate success.\nThis is one of my favorite songs called, Let Her Go by Passenger.\n\nOnly know you love her when you let her go\n\nDocument\nI'd like you to document your learning journey. You no longer have to create a website. You may blog on Medium or use Evernote. You may share with your friends. Your learning journey will be difficult. But once you get it and share with someone else, you will feel more accomplished. I guess that's why I love blogging.\nBe Skeptical\nI’m a biased human being. I hope you do not trust me all the way. &#x1F605; If you spot any practices that raise your eyebrows, make sure challenge me and come up with a better solution. Although I try to prevent that from happening through doing my homework, I encourage you to think outside of the box.\nBe Proactive\nYou might have seen those red error messages on the left side. I expect you to figure out and search what the issue is. Copy and paste the error message on Google. Ask me questions. Do whatever it takes. Do not move on without knowing the cause and how you could prevent them from occurring.\nI mentioned that learning is done by you, not me. I’m here to teach you how to catch fish. I’m going to show you how to use nets and fish rods. After this course, you are expected to use those tools on your own. You might cut yourself through sharp edges, but it's just a part of your learning journey and becoming a stronger version of yourself.\nYour Ideal Learning Stage\n\n\n\nStep\nDetail\n\n\n\n\nThe Why\nEach lesson should flow like a story. In the beginning, I start off with a problem statement. It consists of doubts and questions I personally encountered. For example, I would ask, what's the purpose of using optionals? A problem statement organically leads to why we learn such materials and features\n\n\nApplication\nAfter having gone through the specific problem statement by showing new features and how to use them, I present how it applies to real-life situations.\n\n\nResources\nI attach additional resources for you to study more. You may go further on your own.\n\n\nVisualization\nIt's your turn. I don't believe in practice problems. We no longer live in a world where there are fixed answers. You visualize how the feature you've learned can be applicable for your future endeavor. Albert Einstein said, \"Imagination is more important than knowledge\". Practice problems turn you into a machine. We have more than enough in 2017, by the current education system.\n\n\nTest\nIt's time to put your visualization into practice. You should fail. That's good. You are trying something new. \"Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough\" - Elon Musk\n\n\n\n"},"course/introduction/course-prerequisites.html":{"url":"course/introduction/course-prerequisites.html","title":"Prerequisites","keywords":"","body":"Course Prerequisites\nTo maximize your learning, you should be familiar with the following Swift syntax.\nSwift Fundamentals\nFor-In Loops\nfor _ in 1...100 {\n  print(\"Repeat\")\n}\n\n// \"Repeat\"\n// \"Repeat\"\n// ...\n\nSwitch Statement\nswitch number {\ncase 1...10 :\n  print(\"Your number is between 1 to 10\")\ndefault:\n  print(\"I don't know\")\n}\n\nVar vs Let\nlet imuttableName = \"Bob\"\nvar muttableName = \"Bobby\"\n\nimuttableName = \"SangJoon\" // Error\n\nElse-If Statement\nif isBobHansome {\n  print(\"He good\")\n} else {\n  print(\"That's okay\")\n}\n\nTypes\nlet string = \"String\"\nlet bool = true\nlet double = 20.0\nlet int = 20\n\nArray and Dictionary\nlet countries = [\"S.Korea\", \"USA\", \"Vietnam\", \"Malaysia\"]\nlet info = [\"Height\": 183, \"Age\": 20]\n\nFunction\nfunc returnName() -> String {\n  return \"Bob the Developer\"\n}\n\nBasic Operators\n1 + 1\n3 / 2\n2 * 4\n9 % 5\n\nIntro to Enums\nenum Race: String {\n  case asian\n  case white\n  case black\n  case hispanic\n}\n\nRace.asian.rawValue // \"asian\"\n\nObject Oriented Programming\nYou should be familiar with initialization, property, method, and inheritance\n class Human {\n   let name: String\n\n   init(enterName: String) {\n     name = enterName\n   }\n\n   func sayName() {\n     print(\"Hi, I'm \\(name)\")\n   }\n\n }\n\nIf you are not confident with any of those topics above, you may watch my videos I've for complete beginners below on YouTube.

If you have any questions, feel free to comment below.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/optionals.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/optionals.html","title":"Optionals","keywords":"","body":"Optionals\nIntroduction\nWelcome to first lesson of the Swift Fundamentals with Bob. When I first started programming in Swift just like many of you, I took courses from Udemy, Treehouse, Lynda. I bought books and whatever resources I could acquire to learn iOS Development.\nIn the beginning, however, I could not understand what those ? and ! stood for, and why we use them. Xcode kept telling me what to do on the left side. You probably know what I'm talking about. I got frustrated. It seemed like no courses gave me clear reasons how to use optionals, and most importantly, why Swift engineers have implemented such feature that is so unique compared to other programming languages. Well, if you have asked the similar question, I'm here for you.\nProblem\nWhy did Swift engineers implement optionals?\nImplicit and Explicit Type\nRule\n\nEvery variable type must be defined (Implicit/Explicit)\nThe Type is inferred based on the value\n\n// String\nlet name: String = \"Bob\"          // Explicit\nlet newName = \"Bob the Developer\" // Implicit\n\n// Numbers\nlet myAge: Int = 20               // Explicit\nlet mySisterAge = 14              // Implicit\nlet myGPA: Double = 3.54          // Explicit\n\nFetching Profile Picture\nWhen you fetch a profile picture from Facebook, it may return no value or nil. However, you can't store nil to a normal type based on the rule above.\n// If could return \"URL\" or \"nothing\"\n// Successful\nlet myProfileImageURL: String = \"https//facebook.com/bobthedeveloper\"\n\nlet emptyProfileFile: String // Error\n\nIntroduction to Optionals\nOptional type allows storing nil, a.k.a absence of value.\nlet myName: String? = nil\nlet myNewName: String? = nil\n\nprint(myName)\nprint(myNewName)\n\nlet bobAge: Int? = nil\nlet robAge: Int? = 123\nlet danAge: Int? = 3\n\nOptionals Rules\n\nOptionals/Normal Types do not interact with each other\nConvert Optionals to Normal Type for usage. The process is also known as unwrapping.\n\n// robAge + danAge\n// Error\n\nOptionals Unwrapping\nThere are two ways to convert/unwrap optional types to normal types\n\nForced unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping\n\nForced Unwrapping\n You may convert by inserting ! at the end of  a variable/constant. Forced Unwrapping should be avoided since it causes a crash if an optional contains nil.\nlet profileImageFromFacebook: String? = \"ImageURL...\"\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook) // Optional\n\nvar image = profileImageFromFacebook! // String? converted to String\n\nprint(image) // Normal Type\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook!) // Normal Type\n\nIn order to interact between variables, you must convert.\nlet newRobAge = robAge!\nlet newDanAge = danAge!\n\nnewRobAge + newDanAge // Good\n\nBad things happen when you try to force unwrap an optional type whose value contains nil.\nlet bobAge: Int? = nil\n// let newBobAge = bobAge!\n// Error\n\n\nYou can't store nil to a normal type in Swift. It violates the rule mentioned above.\n\nImplicit Unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping is another way to convert. However, even if an optional type contains nil, it does not break the system. Instead, it ignores. Implicit unwrapping is similar to an else-if statement.\nlet profileImageFromFacebook: String? = \"Bob's pretty image\"\n\nif let image = profileImageFromFacebook {\n  print(image)\n}\n\nNow image is contain a normal type of String. You may use the image constant within the block. If profileImageFromFacebook. contains nil, Swift ignore the { print(\"image)\") }\nSource Code\nResources\nIf you are still stuck with optionals, feel free to watch an additional video similar to this on my YouTube channel.\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob: Optionals (YouTube)\n\n\nConclusion\nYou've learned two fundamental concepts in the Swift programming language. The rule number one is that every variable type, even if optional, has to be defined whether explicitly or implicitly. Second, there are two ways to unwrap optionals to normal types.  ! is used to force unwrap. if let is used to safely unwrap. This lesson might have been easy for you. Still, I just wanted to make sure everyone is on the same page.\nIn our next lesson, you will learn why ? and ! automatically appear when you create an object and access its properties and methods.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/optional-chaining.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/optional-chaining.html","title":"Optional Chainings","keywords":"","body":"Optionals Chainings\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of The Swift Fundamentals. In the previous lesson, you've learned why we use optionals, and there were two ways to unwrap/convert.\nHowever, have you wondered why ? and ! automatically appear when you try to get properties and methods of an object? If you haven't, that's okay. You will find out. The goal is to prevent you from guessing. Let us find out what goes under the hood.\nProblem\nWhy do I see \"?\" and \"!\" when accessing methods and properties?\nOptional Chaining in UIKit\nYou might have seen something like this.\nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel().highlightedTextColor?.cgColor\n\nA mysterious ? appears all of a sudden.\nDesign Human\nCreate a class called Human that contains one property and method.\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n\n  func sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello\")\n  }\n}\n\nDesign Apartment\nCreate Apartment class that contains a property whose type is Human?.\nclass Apartment {\n  var human: Human?\n}\n\nInitialize Property\nCreate an instance of Apartment and assign its human property whose type is optional.\nvar seoulApartment = Apartment()\nseoulApartment.human = Human(name: \"Bobby\")\n\nCall Property and Method\nNow, try to grab the human property of seoulApartment. Since the type of human is optional, ? gets added automatically.\nvar myName = seoulApartment.human?.name // Always return an optional since human is optional.\n\nmyName is an optional type. Therefore, unwrapping is needed.\nif let name = myName {\n  print(name)\n}\n\nRules: When you attempt to access a property whose type is optional, Swift will add ?. Anything that comes after the ? will be optional.\n\nSource Code\nResources\nXcode Shortcuts\nhttps://blog.bobthedeveloper.io/bobs-favorite-xcode-8-shortcuts-part-1-3-36381e07284d\nConclusion\nNow, you no longer have to guess when to use ? and !. It should be particularly useful when you work with the UIKit objects. But, make sure safely unwrap.\nIn our next lesson, you are learn how to use a guard statement to implicitly unwrap multiple optionals, and why you use it instead of using aif let.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/guard-defer-statement.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/guard-defer-statement.html","title":"Guard and Defer Statement","keywords":"","body":"Guard Statement\nIntroduction\nWelcome back to Lesson 3 The Swift fundamentals. First of all, let me share a story of mine. When I learned Swift as my first programming language,  I understood  an else-if statement. It wasn't a big deal. For example, if something is true, run the block of code. However, a guard statement confused the heck out of me. Some of you guys may feel the same way as I did. Don't worry. I'm here for you today. You will understand that a guard statement is just another for you to write an else-if statement. A guard statement promotes zenness. In other words, it adds clarity, emptiness, and lots of cloud and space. Let's get in.\nProblem\nIs there any better way to write an else-if statement? How do you safely unwrap many optionals?\nTypical else-if\nWithout having known guard statements, you probably used a long else-if statement to handle an error message block.\nfunc checkDrinkingAge() {\n  let canDrink = true\n\n  if canDrink {\n    print(\"You may enter\")\n    // More\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n\n  } else {\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    print(\"Let me take you to the jail\")\n  }\n}\n\nIssues with else-if\n\nNested brackets\nHave to read every line to spot the error message\n\nGuard Statement\nA guard block only runs if the condition is false, and it will exit out of the function through return. If the condition is true, Swift will ignore the block.  Eventually, it provides an early exit and fewer brackets.\nfunc checkDrinkProgram() {\n  let iCanDrink = true\n\n  guard iCanDrink else {\n    // if iCanDrink == false, run this block\n    print(\"You can't drink\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  print(\"You may drink\")\n  // You may move on\n  // Come on.\n  // You may leave\n  // You don't need to read this.\n  // Only one bracket on the bottom: feeling zen.\n}\n\nUnwrap Optionals with Else-If\nA guard statement is not only useful for replacing an else-if statement, but also for unwrapping optionals by minimizing the number of brackets. To compare, let's first begin how to unwrap multiple optional types using an else-if.\nFirst, there are three optional types.\nvar publicName: String? = nil\nvar publicPhoto: String? = \"URL\"\nvar publicAge: Int? = 31\n\nWorst Nightmare\n func unwrapOneByOne() {\n  if let name = publicName {\n    if let photo = publicPhoto {\n      if let age = publicAge {\n        print(\"Yes age\")\n      } else {\n        print(\"No age\")\n        return\n      }\n      print(\"Yes photo\")\n    } else {\n      print(\"No photo\")\n      return\n    }\n    print(\"Yes name\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No name\")\n    return\n  }\n}\n\nThe code above certainly works but violates the DRY principle. It's atrocious. Let us break it down.\nSlightly Better\nThe code below is more readable than above.\nfunc unwrapBetter() {\n  if let name = publicName {\n    print(\"Yes name\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No name\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  if let photo = publicPhoto {\n    print(\"Yes photo\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No photo\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  if let age = publicAge {\n    print(\"Yes age\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No age\")\n    return\n  }\n\n}\n\nUnwrap Multiple Optionals with Else-If\nfunc unwrap() {\n  if let name = publicName, let photo = publicPhoto, let age = publicAge {\n    print(\"Your name is \\(name). I see your face here, \\(photo), you are \\(age)\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"Something is missing\")\n    // Animation Logic\n    // Networking\n    // return\n  }\n\nUnwrap Multiple Optionals with Guard\nLet's learn how a guard statement is used as a way to safely/implicitly unwrap optionals.\nfunc safetlyUnwrapUsingGuard() {\n  guard let name = publicName, let photo = publicPhoto, let age = publicAge else {\n    //  If  one or more optionals contain nil\n    print(\"Something is missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  print(\"Your name is \\(name). I see your, \\(photo). You are \\(age).\")\n  // Animation Logic\n  // Networking\n  // More Code, but still zen\n}\n\nDefer Statement\n\nDefer Statement: Put off (an action or event) to a later time; postpone.\n\nIn Swift, it will execute a block of code until the current scope (loop, method, etc) exits.\nfunc simpleDefer() {\n  defer {\n    print(\"Chill, later\")\n  }\n\n  print(\"Print First\")\n}\n\nAnother example,\nfor i in 1...3 {\n  defer { print (\"Deferred \\(i)\") }\n  print (\"First \\(i)\")\n}\n\n// First 1\n// Deferred 1\n// First 2\n// Deferred 2\n// First 3\n// Deferred 3\n\nUsage Case\n Completion handler block, or any code you want to explicitly inform your team without reading the entire block.  function/method.\nSource Code\nResources\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob: Guard Statement (YouTube)\nConclusion\nBy now, I hope you understand the power of using a guard statement. It provides an early exit and you don't have to read all the way to the bottom spot the error messages. You use a guard statement not just to please yourself, but also for the sake of your teammates' falling hair when he/she reads your code.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/intro-error-handling.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/intro-error-handling.html","title":"Intro to Error Handling","keywords":"","body":"Error Handling\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 4: Error Handling. If I remember correctly, Error handling came across as daunting because I thought I had to be a professional debugger to fully utilize the feature. So, I avoided this topic for a while. But, I've noticed, it's nothing more than writing an else-if statement to deal with an error message. However, the large difference is that the Swift Error Handling allows you to write cleaner, modular, and readable code. Let's dive into it.\nProblem\n\nHow do you warn your co-workers the function may result unexpected outcomes?\nWhat is do-try block?\nHow do you distinguish try?, try!, and try?\n\nProblem with Else-If alone\n\nBloated Function\nLack Modularity\nUncertainty\n\nCreate a program for a roller coaster height limit\nfunc checkHeight(height: Int) {\n  if height > 200 {\n    print(\"You are going to hit your head and fall off\")\n    // Take him/her off from the ride\n    // Code ...\n    // Seatbeat Tighten\n\n  } else if height \nError Handling\nError Handling is just additional way to write an else-if statement to deal with error messages\nDesign Error\nCreate an enum that conforms to Error protocol. Determine a few cases.  \n// Design Error\nenum HeightError: Error {\n  case maxHeight\n  case minHeight\n}\n\nDesign Throwable Function\nCreate a function that can throw errors by inserting throws at the end of the function parameter.\nfunc checkHeightError(height: Int) throws {\n  if height > 200 {\n    throw HeightError.maxHeight\n  } else if height \nCall and Handle Error\nTo call a function that contains throws, run the function block by inserting try in front of the function within a do block. A catch block is used to recognize and handle error thrown by the function.\ndo {\n  try checkHeightError(height: 240)\n} catch HeightError.maxHeight {\n  print(\"Get out of here\")\n  // Logic\n} catch HeightError.minHeight {\n  print(\"Too short to ride\")\n}\n\nError Handling to Object Initialization\nError handling not only applies to functions, but also initialization.\nDesign Error\nenum NameError: Error {\n  case noName\n}\n\nDesign Throwable Class\nWhen the user enters an empty string when initializing, the init method throws NameError.noName.\nclass Course {\n  var name: String\n\n  init(name: String) throws {\n    if name == \"\" {\n      throw NameError.noName\n    } else {\n      self.name = name\n      print(\"You've created an object!\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nInit and Handle Error\nCreate an object using try within do.\ndo {\n  let myCourse = try Course(name: \"\")\n} catch NameError.noName {\n  print(\"Please make sure put something\")\n  // Logic\n}\n\nDistinguish Between try?, try!, and try\ntry is only used within a do-catch block. However, try? and try! can be used without it. In other words, you may call throwable method or init without handling error.\ntry?\nIt returns an optional value if it is used for init. If it throws an error, the result will be nil.\nlet newCourse = try? Course(name: \"Bob the Dev\") // returns Course?\nlet newDopeCourse = try? Course(name: \"\") // nil\n\ntry!\nIt will return a normal type if is used for init. If a method/init throws an error, it will crash.\n// try!\nlet myNewCourse = try! Course(name: \"Bobby Lee\")\n// let myDopeNewCourse = try! Course(name: \"\")\n\nSource Code\nResources\nIntro to Error Handling by Bob the Developer\nConclusion\nIn this lesson, you've learned the reason behind the Swift Error Handling syntax such as catch, do, and try. You've also learned the differences between try, try?, and try!. You can only use try when you use it within a do block. However, if you don't care about catching errors that are thrown, you may use try? and try!. Again, avoid using! since it may crash at any time.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn the final usage of ! and ? in the Swift programming language through type castingwhich allows you to convert types that are made with classes. &#x1F914; In fact, you've been using a for a while. Let's learn more.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/type-casting.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/type-casting.html","title":"Type Casting","keywords":"","body":"Type Casting\nIntroduction\nWelcome back to lesson 5 of The Swift Fundamentals with Bob. You might be tired of seeing these !s and ?s since Lesson 1. But you know what, you've got to know all. It is absolutely necessary for you to distinguish their usage in every situation.\nIn this lesson, you are going to learn how to convert types in objects that are created with classes. If you've been programming with Storyboard in iOS, you've been using type casting for a while.\nProblem\n\nHow do you distinguish between as, as?, as! ?\nWhy does Xcode keep telling me what to do?\n\nType Casting in UIKit\nYou've probably seen something like this.\nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel() as UIView\n\n The UIKit framework hierarchy\nHuman Class\nDesign a class called, Human that contains a single method.\nclass Human {\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi, I'm a human\")\n  }\n}\n\nHuman Subclass\nDesign Korean and Japanese that inherit from the Human class.\nclass Korean: Human {\n  func singGangNamStyle() {\n    print(\"Oppa Gangnam Style\")\n  }\n}\n\nclass Japanese: Human {\n  func doNinja() {\n    print(\"Shhh.....\")\n  }\n}\n\nCheck if everything works.\nlet bob = Korean()\nbob.introduce()\nbob.singGangNamStyle()\n\nType Casting\nNow, you may want to convert Korean to Human or Human to Korea. There are two ways: upcasting and downcasting.\nUpcasting\nUpcasting is all about going to its base/super class. Imagine the UIKIt class structure. If you may upcast UILable to UIView. To upcast, use as.\nlet newBob = bob as Human  // Korean -> Human\nnewBob.introduce()\n// newBob.singGangNamStyle()\n// Does not exist\n\nUpcasting Example in Swift\nvar name = \"Bob\" as Any\nvar number = 20 as Any\nvar anyArray = [name, number] // [Any]\n\nDowncasting\nDowncasting is the opposite of upcasting. Downcasting may fail. As a result, you may as force downcasting or implicit downcasting.\nForce Downcasting\nIt does not return an optional type but if it fails, crashes as well.\n// Force Downcasting\nlet newValue = anyArray[0] as! String\n\n\nDowncasting only applies when you upcast first\n\nSafe Downcasting\n It returns an optional type. If downcasting fails, returns nil.\n// Implicit Downcasting (safety)\nlet newNewValue = anyArray[0] as? Int\n\nType Casting in Practice\nCreate Instances\nlet shion = Japanese()\nlet lee = Korean()\nlet kenji = Japanese()\nlet park = Korean()\n\nGroup\nExplicit upcasting\n let humans: [Human] = [shion as Human, lee as Human, kenji as Human, park as Human]\n\nUpcasting inferred\nlet humans: [Human] = [shion, lee, kenji, park]\n\nCall Method in Element\nfor human in humans {\n  if let korean = human as? Korean {\n    korean.singGangNamStyle()\n  }\n\n  if let japanese = human as? Japanese {\n    japanese.doNinja()\n  }\n}\n\nUsage Case in iOS Development\nimport UIKit\n\nlet loginButton = UIButton()\nlet loginMessage = UILabel()\nlet loginView = UIView()\n\nlet UIComponents = [loginButton, loginMessage, loginView]\n\nfor component in UIComponents {\n  if let button = component as? UIButton {\n    // Change background color\n    // Add Title\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  if let label = component as? UILabel {\n\n  }\n\n  if let view = component as? UIView {\n\n  }\n}\n\nHowever, upcasting is not recommended since there is a better way to go about with Protocol Oriented Programming. You will find out more the differences soon. ˜\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {  \n  func introduce() {\n    print(self)\n  }\n}\n\nYou probably have used type casting to identify your designated view controller from Storyboard.\nlet storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil)\nlet vc = storyboard instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"VC\") as! VC\n\nvc.introduce\n\nSource Code\nResources\nIf you are still confused with type casting, feel free to watch my YouTube video I posted earlier.\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorials with Bob: Type Casting (YouTube)\nConclusion\nTo recap, you've learned two ways convert types. One is upcasting with as, which always works because you are going up to the super class and you are getting rid of properties and methods.You've also learned downcasting which converts  object to more specific types within the class hierarchy. However, as you've seen, it may work and may not work. Therefore you use either as?to safely convert. Lastly, you've learnde how type casting can be used to group objects together and apply universal attributes through a for-in loop. However, upcasting isn't recommended in iOS development because it's quite a bit of a headache to convert back and forth, and there is a better way to go about grouping objects together: Protocol Oriented Swift. We will learn more about it in Chapter 3.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/generics.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/generics.html","title":"Intro to Generics","keywords":"","body":"Generics\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 6 of The Swift Fundamentals with Bob. When you think of the word, \"generic\", what makes you think? Well, I'm sure you've thought of writing code that can work with many other types. Some of you guys be like, \"What'?\". I will walk you through. But remember, the number one goal is to write as little as possible, but produce more with.\nProblem\nI smell something.\n\nFor the reference read more about code smell\n\nYour Past\nLet us reflect on how we rolled in the past. Let's attempt to access each element in an array.\nlet highSchoolGPA = [2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.8, 3.5]\nlet favoritePeople = [\"Elon Musk\", \"Steve Jobs\", \"Kevin O'leary\"]\nlet favoriteNumbers = [3, 20]\n\nWorst way to access elements\nhighSchoolGPA[0]\nhighSchoolGPA[1]\nhighSchoolGPA[2]\n\nLoop and Print\nBut, there is a better way.\nfunc printDoubleElement(array: [Double]) {\n  for GPA in array {\n    print(GPA)\n  }\n}\n\nfunc printStringElement(array: [String]) {\n  for person in array {\n    print(\"I love \\(person)\")\n  }\n}\n\nfunc printNumberElement(array: [Int]) {\n  for number in array {\n    print(\"I like \\(number)\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nNeedlessly many functions. It goes against the DRY principle. Don't Repeat Yourself.\n\nIntroducing Generics\nA generic function allows you to pass any value regardless of types.   \nfunc genericFunction(value: anything) {\n  print(value)\n}\n\nfunc genericFunctions(value: WHATEVER) {\n  print(value)\n}\n\nYou may pass any type of value. Swift sets the type of value identical to what the user enters.\ngenericFunction(value: \"Bob\")  // value is String\ngenericFunction(value: true)    // value is Bool\n\nGeneric Loop\nLet us apply to a function that loops through an array.\nfunc printElement(array: [T]) {\n  for element in array {\n    print(element)\n  }\n}\n\nCall the function\nprintElement(array: highSchoolGPA)\nprintElement(array: favoritePeople)\n\n\nGeneric code enables you to write flexible, reusable functions and types that can work with any type, subject to requirements that you define.\n\nNow only you can create a generic function, but also generic classes and structs. First, let's begin with a non-generic struct.\nNon-Generic Struct\nstruct Family {\n  var members = [String]()\n\n  mutating func push(member: String) {\n    members.append(member)\n  }\n}\n\nNon-Generic Instance\nvar myFam = Family()\nmyFam.push(member: \"Bob\")\nmyFam.members\n\nWhat if you need to create a struct whose type isn't String, but Int? You probably have to create an entire new struct whose the members property is in [Int]. Well, it goes against the dry principle. Let's gets started.\nGeneric Struct\nstruct genericFam {\n  var members = [T]()\n\n  mutating func push(member: T) {\n    members.append(member)\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Object Explicitly\nNow, let's create an object from a generic struct. But, you have to specify the type you'd like to interact with.\n// Generic whose type is String\nvar myGenericFamily = genericFam()\nmyGenericFamily.push(member: \"Bobby\")\n\n// Generic whose type is Int\nvar genericFamily = genericFam()\ngenericFamily.push(member: 123)\n\nCreate Object Implicitly\nStruct type inferred based on the property type.\nlet myHappyFamily = genericFam(members: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  // struct is now Int type\n\nGeneric Extension\nGrab the first value\nextension genericFam {\n  var firstElement: T? {\n    if members.isEmpty {\n      return nil\n    } else {\n      return members[0]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet geekFamilyMember = genericFam(members: [\"Bob\", \"Bobby\"])\nlet firstElement = geekFamilyMember.firstElement\n\n```\nResources\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial with Bob: Extension (YouTube)\nIntro to Generics in Swift with Bob (Bob the Developer)\nSource Code\nConclusion\nThat's it. Generics provide such a powerful tool that many of the Swift library is written with generic code. To recap, you've learned how to make a generic function by putting a diamond sign on the right. You've also learned how to create generic structs. In Chapter 6, you will learn a lot more about generics.\nYou've learned a lot. I'm very proud of you. You might not find generics as useful in this course, but when you start learning practical protocol oriented programming, functional programming, and reactive programming, you will find out how generics appear quite often. That being said, let's keep learning.\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/subscripts.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/subscripts.html","title":"Subscripts","keywords":"","body":"Subscripts\nIntroduction\nWelcome back to lesson 7 of The Swift Fundamentals with Bob. What if I told you that you may create a shortcut? I know it sounds abstract. Let's learn more.\nProblem\nI'd love to have a shortcut instead of calling a method.\nNormal Method\nCreate a class called, HelloKitty which contains a method that returns a string value.\nstruct HelloKitty {\n  func saySomething() -> String {\n    return \"I'm Cute\"\n  }\n}\n\nCreate an instance and call saySomething()\nlet babe = HelloKitty()\nbabe.saySomething()\n\nSubscripts\nSubscripts provide shortcuts. It is analogous to creating a method but without a name.\n\nstruct WeekDays {\n  var days = [\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"]\n\n  subscript(index: Int) -> String {\n    return days[index]\n  }  \n}\n\nShortcut\nCall the subscript by entering [].\nlet myDays = WeekDays()\n\nmyDays[0]  // \"Monday\"\nmyDays[1]  // \"Tuesday\"\n\nDictionary\nWhen you access elements in a dictionary, it always returns an optional type.\nvar info = [\"Height\": 183, \"Body Fat\": 12.5, \"Weight\": 76]\n\nlet height = info[\"Height\"] // height is an optional string\n\nArtificial Dictionary Subscript\nAccess element without returning an optional type\nstruct HealthInfo {\n  var info = [\"Height\": 183, \"Body Fat\": 12.5, \"Weight\": 76]\n\n  subscript(key: String) -> Double {\n    if let newInfo = info[key] {\n      return newInfo\n    } else {\n      return 0\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n\nAccess Elements\nReturn normal type\nlet bob = HealthInfo()\nbob[\"Height\"]         // 183\nbob[\"Body Fat\"]        // 12.5\nbob[\"123456789\"]       // 0\n\nShortcoming of Subscript\nNo Context means = ☠️\nResources\nSource Code\n1107_Subscripts\nConclusion\nGreat, now you know what I meant by creating a shortcut. However, subscripts can be quite misleading because there is no name to it. As a result, it might create massive confusion if you work with someone else. So make sure, don't use it too often. Sometimes, it might be better for you to use a property or a method for clarity.\nSwift engineers recommend that, brevity is not the worthwhile goal. Communication is important because a programming language is not only a way humans talk to computers, but also between us, humans. \n"},"course/swift-intermediate/class-struct-difference.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/class-struct-difference.html","title":"Class vs Struct","keywords":"","body":"Class vs Struct\nIntroduction\nGreat to see you at lesson 8 of Part 1 Swift Fundamentals with Bob. I'm super excited. You all know, and you should by now, that there is no inheritance in Structs. Right? Okay, anything else? Sure, there is. Let's find out.\nProblem\n\nWhat's the difference besides inheritance?\nWhen to use Structs over Classes?\n\nCreate Class\nclass HumanClass {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Class Instance\nvar humanClassObject = HumanClass(name: \"Bob\")\nhumanClassObject.name\n\nCreate an instance that has a reference to humanClassObject\nlet newHumanClassObject = humanClassObject\n\nChange the name property of humanClassObject to \"Bobby\". Then, the name property of newHumanClassObject will be also changed to \"Bobby\".\nhumanClassObject.name = \"Bobby\"\nnewHumanClassObject.name // \"Bobby\"\n\nCreate Struct\nstruct HumanStruct {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Struct Object\nvar structObject = HumanStruct(name: \"Bob\")\nlet newStructObject = structObject\n\nChange the name property of structObject to \"Bobby\". However, it has no effect on newStructObject.name because newStructObject is no relationship between the two objects.\nstructObject.name = \"Bobby\"\nnewStructObject.name // \"Bob\"\n\n The difference in value type and reference type\nOne Difference in Mutability\nMutability in Classes\nclass BobClass {\n  var name = \"Bob\"\n}\n\nlet bobClass = BobClass()\nbobClass.name = \"Bobby\"\n\nlet newBobClass = bobClass\n\nnewBobClass.name = \"Bob the Developer\"\nbobClass.name // \"Bob the Developer\"\n\nAlthough the instance, bobClass has been created as a constant, the property of it has been mutated. It is possible because the instance does not own any object, but has a reference to BobClass.\nNo Mutability in Structs\nstruct BobStruct {\n  var name = \"Bob\"\n}\n\nlet bobStruct = BobStruct()\nbobStruct.name\n\n// bobStruct.name = \"Bob Lee\"\n// Error: Immutable\n\nIn structs, when an instance is created with a constant, let, it's not possible to mutate its property because the instance has its own copy and the let protects anyone from interfering with its own instance.\nWhen to use Struct/Value Type?\n\n100,000 - 1,000,000 faster than Class\nNo mutability due to no relationship between objects\nAvoid subclassing if you can to prevent any further headache.\n\nResources\nYou may take a look at why Object Oriented Programming isn't the best option. You don't have to read the entire article. since you will learn about Protocol Oriented Swift in Chapter 4.\nIntro to Protocol Oriented Programming\nSource Code\nConclusion\nYou've learned the fundamental difference in how memory is managed when an object is created either through classes or structs. You've learned the difference between reference type and value type. At this point, you might feel as if there is no point of learning the difference. You are right, when you are creating small apps, it doesn't really matter. But, once you start to have a complex structure, that's when you truly see how OOP can be difficult to manage as you've seen the diagram of the UIKIt Structure created by Apple engineers. ]\n"},"course/swift-intermediate/set-tuple.html":{"url":"course/swift-intermediate/set-tuple.html","title":"Set and Tuple","keywords":"","body":"Set and Tuple\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 9 of The Swift Fundamentals.

In this lesson, you will learn how to become lazy.  In other words, you learn to become smart and effective when it comes to initializing an object. In programming, getting lazy to write less code is in fact good for your teammates and users as long as it's readable. Bill Gates once mentioned, whenever there is hard work to be done, he assigns it to the laziest person as he or she is sure to find an easy way of doing it. So, let's get started.\nProblem\nI'm lazy. Can we initialize quickly?\nCreate Class with Designated Init\nCreate a class called Human\nclass Human {\n var name: String\n\n init(name: String) {\n   self.name = name\n }\n\n init(_ newName: String) {\n   name = newName\n }\n\n}\n\nConvenience Init\nConvenience init initializes the designated init method by calling self.init.\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n\n  init(_ newName: String) {\n    name = newName\n  }\n\n convenience init() {\n   self.init(name: \"Bob\")\n }\n\n convenience init(enterNumber: Int) {\n   self.init(name: String(enterNumber))\n }\n\n}\n\nCreate Objects\nlet ben = Human(\"Hi\")  // init(_ newName: String)\nlet leob = Human()  // convenience init()\nlet bob = Human(name: \"Bob\")  // init(name: String)\n\nlet rob = Human()  // Convenience Init()\nrob.name  // \"Bob\"\n\nInitialize UIColor\nCreate an instance that stores UIColor.\nimport UIKit\n\nlet randomColor = UIColor(colorLiteralRed: 255/255, green: 80/255, blue: 85/255, alpha: 1)\n\nCustom Convenience Init\nCreate our own convenience init that initializes the designated init by adding extension to UIColor.\nextension UIColor {\n convenience init(r: Float, g: Float, b: Float) {\n   self.init(colorLiteralRed: r/255, green: g/255, blue: b/255, alpha: 1)\n }\n}\n\nlet randomColorWtihMe = UIColor(r: 20, g: 10, b: 50)\n\nSource Code\n1201_Convenience Init\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to become lazy and effective at the same time.

Today, we are going to learn how to create relationships between variables. So that you don't need to manage two or more variables separately. Are you confused? Well, have you heard, get and set before? Haven't? No worry. I will walk you through by placing your feet on mine. Let's dive into it.\nProblem\nDo we have to make functions all the time to calculate something?\nAtrocious Code\nUnrelated functions that take up many lines. The functions below are used to calculate radius.\nfunc getDiameter(radius: Double) -> Double {\n return radius * 2\n}\nfunc getRadius(diameter: Double) -> Double {\n return diameter / 2\n}\n\ngetDiameter(radius: 10) // return 20\ngetRadius(diameter: 200) // return 100\ngetRadius(diameter: 600) // return 300\n\nIntroducing Computed Property\nYou may create a variable that only can be read. You may not customize. It is also referred to as a gettable property.\nGettable Property\nCreate a only readable property.\nvar gettaleNumber: Double {\n get {\n   return 123.2\n }\n}\n\nShorter way to express a gettable property by removing the get keyword.\nvar readableVariable: Double {\n return 20\n}\n\nIf you attempt to modify the property, it will give you an error.\ngettableNumber = 10 // Error\nreadableVariable = 20 // Error\n\nGettable and Settable Property\nYou may not only make a property gettable, but also settable by inserting set right after get.  Let us create a relationship between radius and diameter.\nvar radius: Double = 10\nvar diameter: Double {\n get {\n   return radius * 20\n } set {\n   radius = newValue / 2  // newValue refers to the recent set value of diameter\n }\n}\n\nNow, if you set diameter to 100,  newValue becomes 100. As a result, radius will be 50. If you set radius to 500, diameter will be 1000.\nInstead of calling newValue, you may name the recently set value as you wish. In the example below, there is a relationship between area and side. Instead of calling newValue, I call it as newArea.\nimport Foundation\n\nvar side: Double = 100\n\nvar area: Double {\n get {\n   return side * side\n } set(newArea) {\n   side = sqrt(newArea)\n }\n}\n\narea = 400 // side becomes 20\n\nSource Code\n1203_Computed Property\nConclusion\nIn the beginning of the lesson, you've learned what it means to create a gettable property by calling get or just by returning value. After that, you've also learned how to add set which allows you to modify its value as well as those of other variables. We are going to take a look at how Apple Engineers use computed property to create the iOS ecosystem safe and non-customizable. I know you are super excited to build apps.

You are going to learn how to put a tracker to a property. For example, never mind. Let's just do it.\nProblem\nHow can I add observer/tracker to a property?\nwillSet and didSet\n\nwillSet is called just before the value is set\ndidSet is called immediately after the new value is set.\n\nCreate Step Counter\nCreate a variable called, totalSteps. When the variable encounters a new value, you may notify the user that the value has been changed. In the willSet block, newTotalSteps refers to the new value stored. In the didSet block, oldValue refers to the previous value before totalSteps encounters a new value.\nvar totalSteps: Int = 20 {\n willSet(newTotalSteps) {\n   print(\"About to set totalSteps to \\(newTotalSteps)\")\n }\n didSet {\n   if totalSteps > oldValue  {\n     print(\"Added \\(totalSteps - oldValue) steps\")\n   }\n }\n}\n\ntotalSteps = 100  \n// About to set totalSteps to 100\n// Added 80 steps\n\nReal Life Application\nYou may notify the user or change background color once the user successfully logs in to the apps.\nvar userLoggedIn: Bool = false {\n willSet(newValue) {\n   print(\"The user has tried something\")\n }\n didSet {\n   if userLoggedIn {\n     print(\"The user switched from \\(oldValue) to \\(userLoggedIn)\")\n   }\n }\n}\n\nuserLoggedIn = false\n// \"The user has tried something\"\nuserLoggedIn = true\n// \"The user has tried something\"\n// \"The user switched from false to true\"\n\nSource Code\n1206_Property Observer\nConclusion\nGreat! The whole purpose of using property observer is to write less code but provide greater readability. You don't have to create a function with a switch or else-if statement. As you've seen there are ways ways to check whether user has been logged or not, computed property for me works great because it provides a separate block of code with distinct keywords such as didSet and willSet.\nStay Connected\nIf you'd like to be on my mailing list and receive personal updates on upcoming books and courses, feel free to send me an email at bobleesj@gmail.com\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/failable-init.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/failable-init.html","title":"Failable Init","keywords":"","body":"Failable Init\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Object Oriented Programming.

In this lesson, you are going to learn what it means by the word super. A lot of beginners often have no clue but copy because they have seen on StackOver Flow or tutorials. Today, we are going to dive in what's really going on. There are a lot of examples, so let's get started.\nProblem\nProblem: Super... Super.init?\nUIViewController\nYou might have seen something like this below. Many wonder what super and override stand for. Let us find out.\nimport UIKit\n\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {\n override func viewDidLoad() {\n   super.viewDidLoad()\n   print(\"Hello\")\n }\n}\n\nCreate Vehicle Class\nCreate a class called Vehicle. It contains one gettable property and one method.\nclass Vehicle {\n\n var description: String {\n   return \"Hello, I'm moving at 30km/hr\"\n }\n\n func warning() {\n   print(\"Be careful, I'm going pretty fast\")\n }\n\n}\n\nSubclass\nYou may customize inherited properties and methods by inserting override.  You may access inherited properties and methods by calling super.\nclass ToyCar: Vehicle {\n\n let price = \"$100\"\n\n override var description: String {\n   return \"\\(super.description), I'm \\(price)\"\n }\n\n override func warning() {\n   super.warning() // \"Be careful, I'm going pretty fast\"\n   print(\"Let me just tell you, I'm not dangerous much\")\n }\n\n}\n\nSubclass Object\nCreate an object to check if the methods and properties have been overridden in the subclass,ToyCar.\nlet myCar = ToyCar()\nmyCar.description\nmyCar.warning()\n\nSuper Init\nYou may override init from super class. However, the number one rule is: you must put associated value to every property even from the super class.\nDesign Super Class\nCreate a class that contain one property called, origin.\nclass Human {\n var origin: String\n\n init(enterOrgin: String) {\n   origin = enterOrgin\n }\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\nCreate a subclass, called Korean that inherits from Human. The Korean class contains a property called, name.  However, when you initialize, you must initialize the origin property from the Human class by calling super.init.\nclass Korean: Human {\n\n let name: String\n\n // Init Method #1\n init(enterName: String) {\n   name = enterName\n   super.init(enterOrgin: \"Bob the Developer\")\n }\n\n // Init Method #2\n init(enterName: String, myOrigin: String) {\n   name = enterName\n   super.init(enterOrgin: myOrigin)\n }\n\n}\n\nCreate Object\nThere are two init methods in the Korean class. You may choose any since both initialize the origin property from the Human class.\nlet bob = Korean(enterName: \"Bob the Dev\")\nlet bobby = Korean(enterName: \"Bob the Dev\", myOrigin: \"Korean\")\n\nOverride Init\nSimilar to how you may override a method and property, you may include additional lines of code by overriding the init method.\nDesign Base Class\nDesign a class called, Tesla. It contains a property called, numberOfWheels.\nclass Tesla {\n var numberOfWheels: Int\n\n init(enterWheelNumber: Int) {\n   numberOfWheels = enterWheelNumber\n }\n}\n\nOverride Init\nYou may override the init method in the Tesla class. Let us add a print statement when you call the init method.\nclass ModelS: Tesla {\n override init(enterWheelNumber: Int) {\n   super.init(enterWheelNumber: 500)  // Calling the init method\n   print(\"Yo, I've cerated this object bruh\")\n }\n}\n\nlet myFutureSexyCar = ModelS(enterWheelNumber: 500)\n// print(\"Yo, I've cerated this object bruh\")\n\nmyFutureSexyCar.numberOfWheels // 500\n\nSource Code\n1204_Override Init/Method\nConclusion\nNow, you understand what goes under when you see or type phrases such as super.init, super.viewDidLoad, and override.

At the end of this lesson, you will learn how NASA could have saved millions of dollars if they used the feature Swift offers.\nProblem\nHow can one init init the other?\nDesign Struct\nDesign a struct called NuclearRocket. There are two init methods and two properties: meters and liters.\nstruct NuclearRocket {\n  var meters: Double\n  var liters: Double\n\n  // Init for &#x1F1F0;&#x1F1F7;\n  init(meters: Double, liters: Double) {\n    self.meters = meters\n    self.liters = liters\n  }\n\n  // Init for &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8;\n  init(ft: Double, gallons: Double) {\n    let convertedMeters = ft / 3.28\n    let convertedLiters = gallons * 3.79\n    self.init(meters: convertedMeters, liters: convertedLiters)\n  }\n}\n\nUsing the second init method, you may initialize the properties using ft and gallon because it calls the first init method by calling self.init. This is analogous to convenience init.\nCreate Object\nFor Korean scientists\nvar rocket = NuclearRocket(meters: 20, liters: 20)\nrocket.liters\nrocket.meters\n\nFor American scientists\nvar newRocket = NuclearRocket(ft: 300, gallons: 2)\nnewRocket.liters\nnewRocket.meters\n\nSource Code\n1205_Two Phase Init\nConclusion\nGreat, to be honest, I haven't used two phase init in my previous apps before. I just wanted to make sure when you read someone's code, you are ready to rock and roll.\nSo, let's go back to the introduction. Why this is important.  The Mars Climate robot launched by NASA in 1998 to study the Mars.  However, a year later,  communication with the spacecraft was lost as the spacecraft, due to ground-based computer software which produced output in non-SI units of pound instead of the SI units of newton. $327.6 million gone.

In fact, static is the only type property and method used within struct since it does not provide inheritance.\nstruct SomeStructure {\n static var storedTypeProperty = \"Some value.\"\n static var computedProperty: Int {\n   get {\n     return 120\n   }\n   set {\n     print(\"You've set to \\(newValue)\")\n   }\n }\n\n static func hello() {\n   print(\"hello\")\n }\n}\n\nAccess properties\nSomeStructure.computedProperty = 150\nSomeStructure.computedProperty = 24234\n\nClass\nUnlike static, class is only used within Classes. But, Classes also support static. class properties and types may be overridden.\nDesign Class\nCreate a class called GrandParent. It contains one static property and one static method. It also contains a normal method and another method with final attached.\nclass GrandParent {\n static var numberOfYearsInMarriage = 30\n static func introduce() {\n   print(\"We've been married for \\(numberOfYearsInMarriage)\")\n }\n\n func sayHi() {\n   print(\"What's popping?\")\n }\n\n final func sayHello() {\n   print(\"What Up?\")\n }\n\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\nNow, create Parent class that inherits GrandParent.  You may override func sayHi(), but you may not override final func sayHello(). final prevents Classes from overriding. It's similar to static.\nclass Parent: GrandParent {\n override func sayHi() {\n   super.sayHi()\n   print(\"I'm a parent\")\n }\n\n//  override func sayHello() {\n//    print(\"What Up?\")\n//  }\n// Error\n\n}\n\nAccess Type Property and Method\nNow, let us grab numberOfYearsInMarriage and introduction\nParent.numberOfYearsInMarriage // 30\nParent.introduce()\nParent().sayHi()  // Good\nParent().sayHello() // Good\n\nDesign Class\nCreate a class called, Human that contains two type properties.\nclass Human {\n static var legs = 2\n\n // class var name = \"Bob\"\n // Error: Stored property not valid for class var\n\n class var myName: String {\n   return \"Human\"\n }\n\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\n\nAgain, subclasses can override class methods/properties, but cannot override static methods and properties.\n\nCreate a class called, Bob that inherits Human. Attempt to override myName class type property.\nclass Bob: Human {\n override class var myName: String {\n   return \"My name is Bob\"\n }\n}\n\nPractical Usage\nYou may store a list of items using the follow way below.\nclass BluetoothID {\n struct iPhone {\n   static let iPhone4 = \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\n   static let iPhone5 = \"7867-5676-4535-1235\"\n   static let iPhone6 = \"3938-6738-1424-9876\"\n   static let iPhone7 = \"4845-3148-1237-1296\"\n   static let iPhone8 = \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n }\n}\n\nBluetoothID.iPhone.iPhone8\n\nYou may also use enum. but I prefer the method above since I do n't have to call rawValue.\nenum AirDropID: String {\n case iPhone4 = \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\n case iPhone5 = \"7867-5676-4535-1235\"\n case iPhone6 = \"3938-6738-1424-9876\"\n case iPhone7 = \"4845-3148-1237-1296\"\n case iPhone8 = \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n}\n\nAirDropID.iPhone8.rawValue // \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n\nResources\nSource Code\n1207_Type Property and Method\nConclusion\nRemember a couple things. First, if you use final or static, that means you may inherit, but you can not override. Second, when you are using class property, you have to use computed property for some reason I couldn't find out. Right now, you are learning how each organ works one by one. You are learning about the stomach, the larges intestines, and on on. Later in Part 2 and Part 3, you will learn how those organs form the entire digestive system, also known as the iOS platform.\nStay Connected\nIf you'd like to be on my mailing list and receive personal updates on upcoming books and courses, feel free to send me an email at bobleesj@gmail.com\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/singleton-pattern.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/singleton-pattern.html","title":"Singleton Pattern","keywords":"","body":"Singleton Pattern\nIntroduction\nLecture Notes\nProblem\nSource Code\nReference\nConclusion\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/conclusion.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/conclusion.html","title":"Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"Conclusion\nYou've completed Chapter 2 Advanced Object Oriented Programming with me.

You've probably heard or used closures before. So, let me as you this, do you know what completion handlers are used for? If you do, do you know how to build one? Do you know what a trailing closure is and when to use it? If you weren't able to confidently answer to these questions, you've come to the right place. A lot of books and courses do not cover the fundamentals and expects new developers to use them. It's analogous to not knowing what super.viewDidLoad is but you just use it because it somehow works. There are of completion handlers used. You've seen before because it is used for networking, going to the next View Controller, animation, and so on. We don't want that to happen.

When I learned Swift as my firsts programming language, I had a really hard time understanding closures. I avoided it as much as possible, and I didn't know why we use it in the first place. It took me good 3 months to completely understand Closures. So, I don't expect you to be comfortable with closures taking by taking a couple of lessons. It is hard, and you just have to admit it. It's riding a bicycle for the first time. You just have to fall and feel uncomfortable until you get used it. It's like seeing a mathematical formula you've never seen before. You just have to get used it. Enough said, let's find out how closures is different from normal functions. Brace yourself.\nProblem\nWho are you closures? () -> ()?\nDefinition\nA closure is a function without name and the func keyword (for now).\nFunctions\nCreate a function that add two numbers.\nfunc addTwoNumbers(number1: Int, number2: Int) -> Int {\n  return number1 + number2\n}\n\nFirst Class Citizen\nYou may store a function into a variable/constant.\nvar addFunction = addTwoNumbers\naddFunction(10, 14) // 24\naddFunction(14, 21) // 35\n\nIntroducing Closures\nStore closures into a variable. A closure begins with {. In order to store into a variable/constant, you must specify its type.\nvar addClosures: (Int, Int) -> Int = { (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  return number1 + number2\n}\n\naddClosures(4, 10) // 14\naddClosures(52, 123) // 178\n\nShort Form\nYou may not enter return after in if only if you enter the value that the closure expects to return.\nvar sumWithClosure: (Int, Int) -> Int = { (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  number1 + number2\n}\n\nShortest Form\nAs long as you specify the type, you may not create an argument label. You may just insert $0 or $1.\nvar sumWithClosures: (Int, Int) -> Int = { $0 + $1 }\nsumWithClosures(4, 10)\n\nMore Examples\n// No paramter. Just return String\nlet closureString: () -> String = { () in\n  return \"hello\"\n}\n\n// Identical example as above, but shorter form\nlet closuresString: () -> String = { \"hello\" }\nclosuresString()\n\n// Enter two parameters and return Int\nvar timesClosure: (Int, Int) -> Int = { $0 * $1 }\ntimesClosure(523, 12321)\n\nResource\nIf you are not familiar with closures, you may watch this introductory video. You have to get used to it. Again, it took me ages to a couple weeks to get used to it. You must understand. Keep googling on your own.\nThe Complete Swift 3 Tutorial: Closures (YouTube)\nSource Code\n1301_Closures vs Functions\nClosure Part 1\nClosure Part 2\nConclusion\nDo you feel uncomfortable or confused? That's okay. It's just a part of the process of acquiring knowledge. You struggle to learn because it indicates that you are not in your comfort zone. Learning is done by your. So, if you need to, refer to my resources, and google until you figure out what's going on. Don't give up. I hope you are able to distinguish the difference between a function and variable. Remember you can store a function into a variable and carry it around. Also, when you make a closure, you must indicate its type. You've learned how to write a closure statement using longer as well as shorter syntax by putting dollar signs and eliminating in and return. In the next lesson, you will find out how to pass closure as a parameter in a function.\nStay Connected\nIf you'd like to be on my mailing list and receive personal updates on upcoming books and courses, feel free to send me an email at bobleesj@gmail.com\n\n\n    \n\n\n"},"course/functional-swift/intro-closure-part2.html":{"url":"course/functional-swift/intro-closure-part2.html","title":"Intro to Closures Part 2","keywords":"","body":"Closures vs Functions (Part 2)\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of The UIKIt Fundamentals Part 1 Intro to Functional Programming.

Create a function that takes a closure whose type is () -> String.\nfunc insertClosure(closure: () -> String) -> String{\n  return closure()\n}\n\ninsertClosure(closure: returnString)\n\n\nDisclosure: Function is called Global Closure\n\nReturn Closure\nNow only you may pass a closure to a function block, you may return a closure.\nfunc returnClosure() -> ((Int, Int) -> Int) {\n  return { (number1, number2) in number1 + number2 }\n}\n\nlet returnedClosure = returnClosure()\nreturnedClosure(5, 10)\n\nreturnClosure()(5, 15)\n\nReturn Short Closures\nYou might get confused by this. Again, a closure begins with { and ends with }.\nfunc returnShortClosure() -> ((Int, Int) -> Int) {\n  return { $0 * $1 }\n}\n\nreturnShortClosure()(10, 10) // 100\n\nResources\nIf you are not familiar with closures, it takes a while for you to get used to it. I highly recommend you to read my article on No Fear Closures with Bob Part 1 and Part 2.\nSource Code\n1302_Closures vs Functions (Part 2)\nConclusion\nIf you were to take away one thing, please remember this. You can pass closure to an argument label and even return closure. This is the basis of functional programming, which I'm not going to dive into.

Before I talk about details, I'd like to share with you that learning Protocol was such a daunting task. Not only it was located at the end of the Swift documentation, but it just felt really foreign to me. It sounded scary. Of course, it feels natural to use it, so I understand if you are not comfortable with it. I just would like to tell you that you might have to watch this video multiple times to get by. You might have to read 10 more articles for you to fully get comfortable. I really expect you guys to be proactive when you are confused. I will do my part which is to explain in the most clear way possible. Well, let's get started from the bottom with me. Let's go!\nThere are certainly benefits of using OOP, but the opposites as well.\nWhen you subclass, you have to inherit properties and methods which you may not need. Your object becomes unnecessarily bloated.\nWhen you make a lot of super classes, it becomes extremely hard to navigate between each class and fix bugs/edit.\nSince objects are referencing to the same place in memory, if you make a copy and create a small change its property, it can f up the rest. (Mutability due to reference)\nProblem\nProblem: I don't know Protocol\n\nProtocol is like a basketball coach. He/she tells players what to do, but he/she doesn't know how to dunk.\n\nProtocol\nCreate a protocol called, Rookieable. It contains two properties and one method. Do not worry about get and set for now.\nprotocol Rookieable {\nvar numberOfEXP: String { get set }\nvar name: String { get }\n\nfunc introduce()\n}\n\nCreate a class that conforms to Rookieable just like how you would subclass. To prevent Swift from screaming, you must implement two properties and one method defined in the protocol.\nclass Bob: Rookieable {\n// Stored property has no effect on get or set\nvar numberOfEXP: String = \"13\"\nvar name: String = \"Bob\"\n\nfunc introduce() {\nprint(\"Hi, I'm \\(name) and I have \\(numberOfEXP) years of experience\")\n}\n\n}\n\nCreate an object and call the introduce method.\nBob().introduce()\n\n\n{ get } or { get set} only apply to computed property. If you are defining a stored property, you may choose either { get } or { get set }.\n\nComputed Property\nCreate a protocol called, Breathable. It contains two properties: isBreathing and isLiving.\nprotocol Breathable {\nvar isBreating: Bool { get set }\nvar isLiving: Bool { get }\n}\n\nCreate a struct that conforms to Breathable. The struct contains properties: isBreathing and isLiving. Define them as computed properties rather than stored.\nstruct Human: Breathable {\nvar isBreating: Bool {\nget { return true }\nset { } // If no set, error occurs. isBreathing is { get set }\n}\n\nvar isLiving: Bool {\nget { return true }\nset { }\n}\n\n}\n\n\nRule: If you are using a computer property, if it is { get } you may make a property gettable or settable. If it is defined as { get set } within a protocol, you must make it gettable and settable.\n\nResources\nSource Code\n1401_Protocol Basics\nConclusion\nAre you wrapping your heads around? Again, make sure you remember a couple rules. If you use { get } or { get set }. You can both use it as a stored property and change the value as you wish. However, if you identify a property with { get set } please remember if you use computed property, you have to make it settable as well. For { get }, you can do whatever you want. In our next lesson, you are going to see some of practical aspects of Protocol. You've only seen the tip of an ice berg. Let's get started my friend.

Today, you learn the most important concept. It is not technically about protocol oriented programming. You use Protocol, but you will learn how to pass data between two classes using it. There are a lot of bullshit tutorials out there. You've come to the right place. Let me tell you the majority of people don't understand what's going on, and they simply copy off from the screen. Have you ever seen, tableView.delegate = self? What the heck is that?\nProblem\nI don't get it.\n\nYou just have to memorize it. It's a gift from Apple engineers. Take it. Do not question why it works. But, find out why it is useful.You might have to watch this video multiple times\n\nPass Data from ClassOne to ClassTwo\nCreate a protocol called, PassDataDelegate. It contains a method that takes data whose type is in String and returns String.\nprotocol PassDataDelegate {\nfunc passData(data: String) -> String\n}\n\nCreate a class that contains an optional property whose type is PassDataDelegate?.\nclass ClassOne {\nvar delegate: PassDataDelegate?\n}\n\nIf you call the method, passData associated with the property, delegate, it will return nil since you have not initialized delegate.\nClassOne().delegate?.passData(data: \"Bob\")\n\nCreate ClassTwo that conforms to PassDataDelegate.  ClassTwo must contain passData(data: String).\nclass ClassTwo: PassDataDelegate {\n\nfunc passData(data: String) -> String {\nreturn \"You passed \\(data)\"\n}\n\n}\n\nCreate instances\nlet classOne = ClassOne()\nlet classTwo = ClassTwo()\n\nSet classOne.delegate to classTwo. It is possible since classTwo conforms to PassDataDelegate.\nclassOne.delegate = classTwo // you are sending data to classTwo\n\nAs soon as you make the relationship like above, whenver you call a method from classOne, you pass data to classTwo and execute the required method.\nclassOne.delegate?.passData(data: \"123124124\")\n//  \"You passed 123124124\"\nclassOne.delegate?.passData(data: \"Hello\")\n// \"You passed Hello\"\n\nSource code\n1404_Delegate\nResources\nConclusion\nGreat, how was it guys? For those who are confused, you might have to watch this video 5-10 times to get used to it. You might have to search up on Google and learn more. You might have to playaround. If you are confused by my lesson and you are not getting it, it's your fault. It took me 2 weeks to understand delegate. It's not easy. But, you just have to struggle when you are not in the comfort zone.

I'm going to repeat myself. If you are not comfortable with any of these concepts we've learned in POP, don't dare jumping to Part 2. If you do, you are a loser. You don't like challenges. You give up. Again, don't again go to Part 2 if you don't understand any of these concepts. Check all the resources and check all the google results. Practice, and get comfortable. It's not about building apps. You just simply download from Github, and claim that it is yours. You have to understand what's really going on. You know, I've been always straight up telling the truth if you've ever read any of my articles in terms opinions.\nThe only way for you to learn something, is through struggling, and if you are getting confused at all, you are challenging yourself. So, keep learning. Keep visualizing. Keep imaging instead of consuming only. I've attached resources for you to to become a better iOS or Swfit developer. Check those out. You will be surprised how many people commented on the bottom saying they didn't know. But, we've covered everything except functional programming.

Entities such as methods and properties are declared only once but used repeatedly. Design APIs to make those uses clear and concise. When evaluating a design, reading a declaration is seldom sufficient; always examine a use case to make sure it looks clear in context.\nClarity is more important than brevity. Although Swift code can be compact, it is a non-goal to enable the smallest possible code with the fewest characters. Brevity in Swift code, where it occurs, is a side-effect of the strong type system and features that naturally reduce boilerplate.\nWrite a documentation comment for every declaration. Insights gained by writing documentation can have a profound impact on your design, so don’t put it off.\nPromote Clear Usage\nInclude all the words needed to avoid ambiguity for a person reading code where the name is used.\nextension List {\n  public mutating func remove(at position: Index) -> Element\n}\nemployees.remove(at: x)\n\nemployees.remove(x) // unclear: are we removing x?\n\nOmit needless words\nIn particular, omit words that merely repeat type information.\npublic mutating func removeElement(_ member: Element) -> Element?\nallViews.removeElement(cancelButton)\n\npublic mutating func remove(_ member: Element) -> Element?\n\nallViews.remove(cancelButton) // clearer\n\nName variables, parameters, and associated types according to their roles, rather than their type constraints.\nvar string = \"Hello\"\nprotocol ViewController {\n  associatedtype ViewType : View\n}\nclass ProductionLine {\n  func restock(from widgetFactory: WidgetFactory)\n}\n\nvar greeting = \"Hello\"\nprotocol ViewController {\n  associatedtype ContentView : View\n}\nclass ProductionLine {\n  func restock(from supplier: WidgetFactory)\n}\n\nCompensate for weak type information to clarify a parameter’s role.\nfunc add(_ observer: NSObject, for keyPath: String)\n\ngrid.add(self, for: graphics) // vague\n\nfunc addObserver(_ observer: NSObject, forKeyPath path: String)\ngrid.addObserver(self, forKeyPath: graphics) // clear\n\nStrive for Fluent Usage\n Prefer method and function names that make use sites form grammatical English phrases.\n x.insert(y, at: z)          “x, insert y at z”\nx.subViews(havingColor: y)  “x's subviews having color y”\nx.capitalizingNouns()       “x, capitalizing nouns”\n\nx.insert(y, position: z)\nx.subViews(color: y)\nx.nounCapitalize()\n\n\nIt is acceptable for fluency to degrade after the first argument or two when those arguments are not central to the call’s meaning:\n\nBegin names of factory methods with “make”, e.g. x.makeIterator()\nlet foreground = Color(red: 32, green: 64, blue: 128)\nlet newPart = factory.makeWidget(gears: 42, spindles: 14)\n\nlet foreground = Color(havingRGBValuesRed: 32, green: 64, andBlue: 128)\nlet newPart = factory.makeWidget(havingGearCount: 42, andSpindleCount: 14)\n\nName functions and methods according to their side-effects\n// Those without side-effects should read as noun phrases, e.g. x.distance(to: y), i.successor().\n\n// Those with side-effects should read as imperative verb phrases, e.g., print(x), x.sort(), x.append(y).\n\nimperative for the mutating method and apply the “ed” or “ing” suffix to name its nonmutating counterpart.\nWhen adding “ed” is not grammatical because the verb has a direct object, name the nonmutating variant using the verb’s present participle, by appending “ing.”\n\n\n\nMutating\nNon-Mutating\n\n\n\n\nx.sort()\nz = x.sorted()\n\n\nx.append(y)\nz = x.appending(y)\n\n\n\nTry to use Struct over Classes\nIf you need extra features, use protocol extension\nFactory Method\nCamel Case\n Start with Uppercase for Protocol, Class, Types, Enum and lowercase for everything else\nType\nTry not ot use NS.\nType Casting\nbob as[String] // &#x1F645;‍\nbob as [String] // &#x1F646;‍\n\nType Inference\nlet selector = #selector(viewDidLoad)\nview.backgroundColor = .red\nlet toView = context.view(forKey: .to)\nlet view = UIView(frame: .zero)\n\nlet selector = #selector(ViewController.viewDidLoad)\nview.backgroundColor = UIColor.red\nlet toView = context.view(forKey: UITransitionContextViewKey.to)\nlet view = UIView(frame: CGRect.zero)\n\nNS Type\nAvoid it\nProtocol\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {\n  // class stuff here\n}\n\n// MARK: -

Only talk to your immediate friends.\n\nElaboration\nAny section of code (code block, function, class, etc) should minimize the dependencies on other areas of code. This is achieved by using shared variables as little as possible. Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured computer system and a good design, and when combined with high cohesion, supports the general goals of high readability and maintainability.\nEliminate, minimize, and reduce complexity of necessary relationships.\nBy hiding implementation details, coupling is reduced.\nHide Implementation Detail\nHiding implementation details allows change to the implementation of a code component while minimally affecting any other modules that use that component.\nA software module hides information (i.e. implementation details) by providing an interface, and not leak any unnecessary information.\nYou may follow a couple principles:\n\nMinimize accessibility of classes and members.\nDon’t expose member data in public.\nAvoid putting private implementation details into a class’s interface.\nDecrease coupling to hide more implementation details.\n\n\n\nBoy-Scout Rule\n\"Leave the campground cleaner than you found it”.

The Product Owner (clients, CEO) orders the Product Backlog Items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, and date needed.\n\n\nSprint\n1 week to 1 month of period to execute requirements\n\n\nSprint Backlog\nThe Sprint Backlog is the list of work the Development Team must address during the next Sprint.\n\n\nProduct Inclement\nThe sum of all the Product Backlog Items completed during a Sprint, integrated with the work of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the increment must be complete, according to the Scrum Team's definition of done (DoD), fully functioning, and in a usable condition regardless of whether the client decides to actually release it.\n\n\n\nThe Agile Manifesto Definition\nAgile software development methodologies follow a set of ground principles created by leading software engineers.\n\nContinuous Delivery\nWelcome changing requirements\nDeliver working software frequently\nInvolve business and developers throughout the project\nBuild projects around motivated folks\nCommunication should be face-to-face\nPrimary metric of progress is working software\nAll participants should maintain a constant pace\nContinuous attention to tech excellence & good design\nSimplicity is essential\nSelf organizing teams\nPeriodic retrospectives\n\nOrganization\nThere are three roles defined in Scrum: the ScrumMaster, the Product Owner, and the Team. Every role work together closely on a daily basis.\nThe Team\nThe Team is a self-organizing and cross-functional group of people who do the hands-on work of developing and testing the product. Since the Team is responsible for producing the product, it must also have the authority to make decisions about how to perform the work. The Team is therefore self-organizing: Team members decide how to break work into tasks, and how to allocate tasks to individuals, throughout the Sprint. The Team size should be kept in the range from five to nine people\nThe Scrum Master\n\nRemove the barriers between the development Team and the Product Owner so that the Product Owner directly drives development.\nTeach the Product Owner how to maximize return on investment (ROI), and meet his/her objectives through Scrum.\nImprove the lives of the development Team by facilitating creativity and empowerment.\nImprove the productivity of the development Team in any way possible.\nImprove the engineering practices and tools so that each increment of functionality is potentially shippable.\nKeep information about the Team’s progress up to date and visible to all parties.\nThe Scrum Master is not a traditional team lead or project manager\nActs as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences.\nEnsures that the Scrum framework is followed.\nThe role has also been referred to as a team facilitator or servant-leader to reinforce these dual perspectives.\n\nProduct Owner\n The Product Owner is the keeper of the requirements. He provides the “single source of truth” for the Team regarding requirements and their planned order of implementation. The Product Owner represents the product's stakeholders and the voice of the customer; and is accountable for ensuring that the team delivers value to the business. The Product Owner writes customer-centric items (typically user stories), prioritizes them based on importance and dependencies, and adds them to the Product Backlog. Scrum Teams should have one Product Owner. This role should not be combined with that of the Scrum Master.\n As the face of the team to the stakeholders, the following are some of the communication tasks of the Product Owner to the stakeholders\n\nThe Product Owner demonstrates the solution to key stakeholders who were not present at a Sprint Review.\nThe Product Owner defines and announces releases\nThe Product Owner communicates team status\nThe Product Owner organizes milestone reviews\nThe Product Owner educates stakeholders in the development process\nThe Product Owner negotiates priorities, scope, funding, and schedule\nThe Product Owner ensures that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear.\n\nOverall Scrum Process\n\nDetermine product backlogs based on priority\nDetermine which backlogs to complete for a sprint\nModularize the selected backlogs into tasks. Each task should require 2-3 hours to complete .\nDuring the sprint, run a daily meeting at the same time and location that last 10-15 minutes\nWhen the sprint is over, have a review meeting and demo day.\nPrepare for next sprints\n\nUser Story\nScrum does not define just what form requirements are to take, but simply says that they are gathered into the Product Backlog, and referred to generically as “Product Backlog Items,” or “PBIs” for short. Given the time-boxed nature of a Sprint, we can also infer that each set should require significantly less time to implement than the duration of the Sprint\nA User Story describes a desired feature (functional requirement) in narrative form. User Stories are usually written by the Product Owner, and are the Product Owner’s responsibility.\nName: Planner enters new contact into address book, so that he can contact the person later by postal or electronic mail\nDescription: Planner enters standard contact information (first and last name, two street address lines, city, state, zip / postal code, country, etc.) into contact-entry screen. He clicks “Save” to keep the data, and “Cancel” to discard data and return to previous screen.\nHow to test: Tester enters and saves the data, finds the name in the address book, and clicks on it. He sees a read-only view of the contact-entry screen, with all data previously entered.\nCreate a list of backlog items\n\n\n\nID\nName\nPriority\nDays\nDemo\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n1\nTransfer Money\n30\n5\nLogIn, page, $10\nNo need to care about passwords\n\n\n2\nBalance sheet\n10\n5\nWithdraw page\nThe balance sheet has to look pretty\n\n\n\n\nDays = number of days x developer(s) and every backlog item must have a leader.\n\nDaily Scrum\nGo through three following questions\n\nWhat did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint goal?\nWhat will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint goal?\nDo I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint goal?\n\nAny impediment (e.g., stumbling block, risk, issue, delayed dependency, assumption proved unfounded) identified in the Daily Scrum should be captured by the Scrum Master and displayed on the team's Scrum board or on a shared resolved, owned, accepted, mitigated (ROAM) board, with an agreed person designated to working toward a resolution (outside of the Daily Scrum). No detailed discussions should happen during the Daily Scrum.\nFoundation\nThese three pillars require trust and openness in the team, which the following five values of Scrum enable:\n\nCommitment: Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every Sprint.\nCourage: Team members know they have the courage to work through conflict and challenges together so that they can do the right thing.\nFocus: Team members focus exclusively on their team goals and the Sprint Backlog; there should be no work done other than through their backlog.\nOpenness: Team members and their stakeholders agree to be transparent about their work and any challenges they face.\nRespect: Team members respect each other to be technically capable and to work with good intent.\n\nSprint Meeting\nThis is the most important event in the process. These are following outcomes:\n\nOne sprint purpose\nsprint backlog\ndemo day\nDaily meet up time and place\nproduct owner must attend\n\nThe scrum methodology always has a strict time line.\n\n\n\nTime\nTasks\n\n\n\n\n13:00 - 13:30\nThe product owner reviews the purpose, product backlog, demo, and date.\n\n\n13:40 - 15:00\nThe team determines approximate time. If needed, the backlog is modularized and organized\n\n\n15:10 - 16:00\nThe team chooses product backlog items\n\n\n16:10 - 17:00\nChoose time and place for daily standup.  Modularize the selected stories\n\n\n\nDemo Day\nEvery sprint must end up with a demo day. Here is a list of reasons,\n\nTeam may feel good for the achievement\nThe team knows which tasks they have implemented\nFeedbacks generated from the feature\nDemo instills new conversations and ideas.\n\nDemo Day Tips\n\nCheck if the demo aligns with the sprint purpose\nDon't spend too much time on demo. No need to be fancy.\nDemo must be business oriented. Instead of how you did, focus on what you did.\nYou may mention small bugs, but do not point out aggressively.\n\nSprint Retrospectives\nSprint reflection is a must since it allows the team to improve and share honest thoughts and feelings during the process.\nTwo main questions are asked in the Sprint Retrospective: What went well during the Sprint? What could be improved in the next Sprint?\nThe recommended duration is one-and-a-half hours for a two-week Sprint (pro-rata for other Sprint durations)\nThis event is facilitated by the Scrum Master\n\nIt should last 1-3 hours.\nThe team lead and team members join\nHold the meeting somewhere casual and loose\nThe team lead reflects upon the dashboard\nCheck the predicted hours versus the hours actually spent. Ask why.\nThe team lead suggests or asks how can the team improve the development process\n\nRest between Sprints\nYou can't always \"sprint\". Going through Scrum reflection and planning is the worst. You should take your team to restaurants, and relax.\nBenefits of Scrum\n\n\n\nBeneficiary\nBenefits\n\n\n\n\nCustomers\nCustomers find that the vendor is more responsive to development requests. High-value features are developed and delivered more quickly with short cycles, than with the longer cycles favored by classic “waterfall” processes.\n\n\nVendors\nVendors reduce wastage by focusing development effort on high-value features, and reduce time-to-market relative to waterfall processes due to decreased overhead and increased efficiency. Improved customer satisfaction translates to better customer retention and more positive customer references.\n\n\nDevelopment Teams\nTeam members enjoy development work, and like to see their work used and valued. Scrum benefits Team members by reducing non-productive work (e.g., writing specifications or other artifacts that no one uses), and giving them more time to do the work they enjoy. Team members also know their work is valued, because requirements are chosen to maximize value to customers.\n\n\nProduct Managers\nProduct Managers, who typically fill the Product Owner role, are responsible for making customers happy by ensuring that development work is aligned with customer needs. Scrum makes this alignment easier by providing frequent opportunities to re-prioritize work, to ensure maximum delivery of value.\n\n\nPMOs and C-Executives\nScrum provides high visibility into the state of a development project, on a daily basis. External stakeholders, such as C-Level executives and personnel in the Project Management Office, can use this visibility to plan more affectively, and adjust their strategies based on more hard information and less speculation.\n\n\n\nOverall\n Agile development cycle\nBook\nEssential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process\nScrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time\nReference\nscrummethodology.com\nWhat is Agile?
