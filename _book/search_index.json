Swift with Bob\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nAs a developer whose first programming language is Swift, I've taken online courses from major platforms. However, I have been frustrated by a lack of detailed explanations from instructors. They tend to focus on final products, thus missing out the fundamentals. I was confused by which design principles to follow, and why. After I've been blogging for the last 5 months, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine. I've received hundreds of emails and questions regarding how to write code that does not violate principles such as DRY, modularity, and readability. As a result, I've decided to create this course dedicated for my younger self. I believe it all comes down to the fundamentals which I lacked in the beginning.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

As a life-long student, I've always wanted to have a complete overview of what I've learned. Most instructors avoid documenting since it takes effort besides making videos alone. I chose the road less traveled to help my students and differentiate myself from the competitive marketplace.\nPersonal Motivation\nI feel grateful for what learning offers in my life. It would have been impossible for me to create this course and communicate in English. I've decided to devote my career providing affordable education channels for all people globally. As a person who has lived in third world countries and also attended college in NYC, I understand, education is the way for anyone rise up and increase a standard of living and quality of life. To pursue this grand goal, I have started off with teaching iOS development to raise funds and increase my personal brand.\nI can't even...

You've made the right choice. You won't regret the decision to embark the journey with me. Before you and I jump into the lessons, let us go through the prerequisites, table of content, and course expectation.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy. If you wish to receive a discount link, you may sign up here.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis course is designed for Swift intermediate. So, I won't cover the basics. Please visit learnSwiftwithBob.com and go to prerequisites. You will find a list of items you are expected to know. There is a YouTube video for each concept, so if you ever get stuck, you can always learn and come back. In a nutshell, you should be already be familiar with switch, else-if, basic enums, function, and what it means to initialize properties.\nVariables and Constants\nlet imuttableName = \"Bob\"\nvar muttableName = \"Bobby\"\n\nimuttableName = \"SangJoon\" // Error\n\nVariable vs Constants\nConditional Statement\nif isBobHansome {\n  print(\"He good\")\n} else {\n  print(\"That's okay\")\n}\n\nConditional Statement\nArray and Dictionary\nlet countries = [\"S.Korea\", \"USA\", \"Vietnam\", \"Malaysia\"]\nlet info = [\"Name\": \"Bob\", \"Age\": \"20\"]\n\nArray and Dictionary\nFor-In Loops\nfor _ in 1...100 {\n  print(\"Repeat\")\n}\n\n// \"Repeat\"\n// \"Repeat\"\n// ...\n\nFor-In Loop\nSwitch Statement\nswitch number {\ncase 1...10 :\n  print(\"Your number is between 1 to 10\")\ndefault:\n  print(\"I don't know\")\n}\n\nSwitch Statement\nFunction\nfunc returnName() -> String {\n  return \"Bob the Developer\"\n}\n\nFunction\nIntro to Enums\nenum Race: String {\n  case asian\n  case white\n  case black\n  case hispanic\n}\n\nRace.asian.rawValue // \"asian\"\n\nBasic Enum\nObject Oriented Programming\nYou should be familiar with initialization, property, method, and inheritance\n class Human {\n   let name: String\n\n   init(enterName: String) {\n     name = enterName\n   }\n\n   func sayName() {\n     print(\"Hi, I'm \\(name)\")\n   }\n }\n\nWhat is Object Oriented Programming\nInheritance\nInitialization\nTable of Content\nThere are 8 chapters in this course. From Chapter 1 to 4, you will get a firm understanding of Intro to Functional, and Protocol, and Object Oriented Programming. In Chapter 5, you will fully understand how objects are created and removed. In Chapter 6 and 7, you will learn how to create value oriented swift code along with protocols, generics, and enums. In the last chapter, you will acquire various advanced and hidden tips about the Swift programming language.\nCourse Expectation\nBased on the Stack Overflow survey in 2016, Swift is considered as the second most loved language out of thousands. However, don't let its readability and hype fool you. It's a complex language inspired by many. Let us through the course expectation.\nBe Skeptical\nI’m a biased human being. I hope you do not trust me all the way. If you spot any practices that raise your eyebrows, make sure challenge me and come up with a better solution. Although I try to prevent that from happening through doing my homework, I encourage you to think outside of the box.\nBe Proactive\nYou might have seen those red error messages on the left side. I expect you to figure out and search what the issue is. Copy and paste the error message on Google. Ask me questions. Do whatever it takes. Do not move on without knowing the cause and how you could prevent them from occurring in the future.\nLearning Mentality\nLearning is done by you, not me. I’m here to teach you how to catch fish. I’m going to show you how to use nets and fish rods. After this course, you are expected to use those tools on your own. You might cut yourself through sharp edges, but it's just a part of your learning journey and becoming a stronger version of yourself.\nIdeal Learning Stage\nLet us through an ideal learning stage for the students.\n\n\n\nStep\nDetail\n\n\n\n\nThe Why\nEach lesson should flow like a story. In the beginning, I start off with a problem statement. It consists of doubts and questions I personally encountered. For example, I would ask, what's the purpose of using optionals? A problem statement organically leads to why we learn.\n\n\nApplication\nAfter having gone through the specific problem statement by showing new features and how to use them, I present how it applies to real-life situations.\n\n\nResources\nWith additional resources and references, you may go further study on your own.\n\n\nVisualization\nIt's your turn. I don't believe in practice problems. We no longer live in a world where there are fixed answers. You visualize how the feature you've learned can be applicable for your future endeavor. Albert Einstein said, \"Imagination is more important than knowledge\". Practice problems turn you into a machine. We have more than enough by the current education system designed to reduce cost for testing.\n\n\nTest\nIt's time to put your visualization into practice. You should fail. That's good. You are trying something new. \"Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough\" - Elon Musk\n\n\n\n"},"course/introduction/course-resources.html":{"url":"course/introduction/course-resources.html","title":"Resources","keywords":"","body":"Resources\nI've prepared a list of resources that would maximize your learning potential.

When I first started programming in Swift, I took courses from Udemy, Treehouse, Lynda, and many more. Yet, I could not understand what those ?s and !s stood for.  Xcode kept telling me what to do on the left side, causing more problems. It seemed like no instructor could explain the reasoning behind how to use optionals, and most importantly, why Swift engineers have implemented a such feature that is unique compared to other programming languages. Today, You will discover the why with me.\nProblem\nWhy did Swift engineers implement optionals?\nImplicit and Explicit Type\nRules\n\nEvery variable type must be defined (Implicit/Explicit)\nThe type is inferred based on the value\n\n// String\nlet name: String = \"Bob\"          // Explicit\nlet newName = \"Bob the Developer\" // Implicit\n\n// Numbers\nlet myAge: Int = 20               // Explicit\nlet mySisterAge = 14              // Implicit\nlet myGPA: Double = 3.54          // Explicit\n\n\nReasons for the rules above Google Slide\n\nFetching Profile Picture\nWhen you fetch a profile picture from Facebook, it may return no value, a.k.anil. However, you may not store nil to a normal type based on the rule above.\n// If could return \"URL\" or \"nothing\"\n\n// Successful\nlet myProfileImageURL: String = \"https//facebook.com/bobthedeveloper\"\n// Error\nlet myProfilePictureURL: String = nil\n\nIntroduction to Optionals\nOptionals allow storing nil, a.k.a absence of value.\nlet myName: String? = nil\nlet yourName: String? = \"Bob Lee\"\n\nprint(myName) // nil   \nprint(yourName) // Optional(\"Bob Lee\")\n\nlet bobAge: Int? = nil\nlet robAge: Int? = 123\nlet danAge: Int? = 3\n\nOptionals Rules\n\nOptionals/Normal Types do not interact with each other\nConvert Optionals to Normal Types for usage. The process is also known as unwrapping.\n\nrobAge + danAge\n// Error\n\nOptionals Unwrapping\nThere are two ways to convert/unwrap optional types to normal types\n\nForced unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping\n\nForced Unwrapping\n You may convert by inserting ! at the end of  the variable. Forced Unwrapping should be avoided since it causes a crash if the optional type contains nil since a normal type can't store nil.\nlet profileImageFromFacebook: String? = \"ImageURL...\"\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook) // Optional\n\nNow, let us unwrap profileImageFromFacebook.\nvar image = profileImageFromFacebook! // String? converted to String\nprint(image) // Normal Type\nprint(profileImageFromFacebook!) // Normal Type\n\nYou must unwrap to work with variables.  \nlet newRobAge = robAge!\nlet newDanAge = danAge!\n\nnewRobAge + newDanAge // Good\n\nBad things happen when you try to force unwrap an optional type whose value contains nil.\nvar image: String? = nil\nlet normalImage = image!  // let normalImage = nil\n// Error\n\n\nYou can't store nil to a normal type in Swift. It violates the Swift rule.\n\nImplicit Unwrapping\nImplicit unwrapping is a safe way to convert. If the optional type contains nil, it does not break the system. Instead, it ignores. Implicit unwrapping is an added feature to an else-if statement.\nlet imageFromFaceBook: String? = \"Bob's Face\"\n\nif let normalImage = imageFromFaceBook {\n  print(normalImage)\n} else {\n  print(\"There is no image\")\n}\n\nNow normalImage contains a normal type of String. You may use the normalImage constant within the if block. On the contrary, if imageFromFaceBook contains nil, Swift executes the else block instead.\nSource Code\n1001_optionals.playground\nResources \n\n\nConclusion\nYou've learned two fundamental concepts in the Swift Programming Language. The rule number one states, every type, even if optionals, has to be defined explicitly or implicitly. Second, there are two ways to unwrap optionals to normal types.  You may force unwrap with ! or safety unwrap with if-let.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn why ? and ! automatically appear when you create an object and access its properties and methods. \n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/optional-chaining.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/optional-chaining.html","title":"Optional Chainings","keywords":"","body":"Optionals Chainings\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of The Swift Fundamentals. In the previous lesson, you've learned why we use optionals and how to convert them to normal types.\nHowever, you might have wondered why ? and ! automatically appear when you access properties and methods of an object. If you haven't, that's okay. The goal is to prevent you from guessing. Let us find out what goes under the hood\nProblem\nWhy do I see ? and ! when accessing methods and properties?\nOptional Chaining in UIKit\nYou might have seen,  \nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel().highlightedTextColor?.cgColor\n\nThe mysterious ? appears all of a sudden. Let us attempt to replicate the phenomenon.\nDesign Human\nCreate a class, Human, which contains a String property, name and a method, sayHello().\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n\n  func sayHello() {\n    print(\"Hello, I'm \\(name)\")\n  }\n}\n\nDesign Apartment\nCreate a class, Apartment, which contains a property whose type is Human?.\nclass Apartment {\n  var human: Human?\n}\n\nInitialize Property\nCreate an instance of Apartment and assign its human property.\nvar seoulApartment = Apartment()\nseoulApartment.human = Human(name: \"Bobby\")\n\nCall Property and Method\nNow, try to grab the human property of seoulApartment. Since the type of human is optional, ? gets added automatically.\n\nRules: When you access a property whose type is optional, Swift will add ?. Anything that comes after the ? will be optional.\n\n\nvar myName = seoulApartment.human?.name // Always return an `optional` type since human is `optional`.\n\nmyName is an optional type. Therefore, unwrapping is needed.\nif let name = myName {\n  print(name)\n}\nForce Unwrap\nYou may force unwrap while optional chaining. However, if the property is not initialized, it will crash.\nvar NYCApartment = Apartment()\nlet NYCResident = NYCApartment.human!.name // Error: No value for human\n\nSource Code\n1002_optional_chainings.playground\nResources\nMy Favorite Xcode Shortcuts Part 1, Part 2, Part 3\nConclusion\nYou've learned optional chaingins provide shortcuts to nested properties and methods among classes and structs. However, ? automatically appears when you access a property whose type is optional to indicate that anything that comes after may contain no value since the optional property may be nil.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn how to use a guard statement to implicitly unwrap multiple optionals instead of classic if let statements.\nAgain, if you wish to increase your coding productivity, feel free to check my articles posted.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/guard-defer-statement.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/guard-defer-statement.html","title":"Guard and Defer Statement","keywords":"","body":"Guard Statement\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 3 of The Swift Fundamentals. When I started learning Swift for the first time, an else-if statement made sense. However, a guard statement rather seemed daunting. In fact, the name doesn't tell anything about what it does. One day, however, I discovered something. A guard statement is just another for you to write an else-if statement. A guard statement promotes zenness. In other words, it adds clarity, emptiness, and lots of cloud and space. Let us find out through examples.\n\nZenness: A trait where peace, calmness, and inner awesomeness are all intertwined - Urban Dictionary\n\nProblem\n\nIs there any alternative way to write an else-if statement?\nHow do you safely unwrap multiple optionals?\n\nTypical Else-If\nWithout having known about guard, you have used a long else-if statement to indicate an error message block.\nfunc checkDrinkingAge() {\n  let canDrink = true\n\n  if canDrink {\n    print(\"You may enter\")\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n\n  } else {\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    // More Code\n    print(\"Let me take you to the jail\")\n  }\n}\n\nIssues with Else-If\n\nNested brackets\nHave to read every line to spot the error message\n\nGuard Statement\nA guard block only runs if the condition is false, and it will exit out of the function through return. If the condition is true, Swift ignores the guard block. It provides an early exit and fewer brackets.\nfunc checkDrinkProgram() {\n  let iCanDrink = true\n\n  guard iCanDrink else {\n    // if iCanDrink == false, run this block\n    print(\"Let's me take you to the jail\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  print(\"You may drink\")\n  // You may move on\n  // Come on.\n  // You may leave\n  // You don't need to read this.\n  // Only one bracket on the bottom: feeling zen.\n}\n\nUnwrap Optionals with Else-If\nA guard statement is not only useful for replacing a typical conditional block with an else-if statement, but also great for unwrapping optionals by minimizing the number of brackets. To compare, let's first begin how to unwrap multiple optionals with else-if.\nFirst, let us create three optionals that will be unwrapped.\nvar publicName: String? = \"Bob Lee\"\nvar publicPhoto: String? = \"Bob's Face\"\nvar publicAge: Int? = nil\n\nThe Worst Nightmare\nYou never want to do this.\nfunc unwrapOneByOne() {\n  if let name = publicName {\n    if let photo = publicPhoto {\n      if let age = publicAge {\n        print(\"Bob: \\(name), \\(photo), \\(age)\")\n      } else {\n        print(\"age is mising\")\n      }\n    } else {\n      print(\"photo is missing\")\n    }\n  } else {\n    print(\"name is missing\")\n  }\n}\n\nThe code above certainly works but violates the DRY principle. It's atrocious. Let us break it down.\n\nDRY: Don't Repeat Yourself\n\nSlightly Better\nThe code below is more readable than above.\nfunc unwrapBetter() {\n  if let name = publicName {\n    print(\"Yes name\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No name\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  if let photo = publicPhoto {\n    print(\"Yes photo\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No photo\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  if let age = publicAge {\n    print(\"Yes age\")\n  } else {\n    print(\"No age\")\n    return\n  }\n}\n\n\nWhen Swift encounters return, it stops and exits out of the function immediately\n\nUnwrap with Guard\nThe else-if statements can be replaced with guard.\nfunc unwrapOneByOneWithGuard() {\n  guard let name = publicName else {\n    print(\"Name missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  guard let photo = publicPhoto else {\n    print(\"Photo missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  guard let age = publicAge else {\n    print(\"Age missing\")\n    return\n  }\n  print(name)\n  print(photo)\n  print(age)\n}\n\nUnwrap Multiple Optionals with Else-If\nSo far, you've been unwrapping optionals one by one. Swift allows us to unwrap multiple optionals at once. If one of them contains nil, it will execute the else block.\nfunc unwrap() {\n  if let name = publicName, let photo = publicPhoto, let age = publicAge {\n    print(\"Your name is \\(name). I see your face right here, \\(photo), you are \\(age)\")\n  } else {\n    // if any one of those is missing\n    print(\"Something is missing\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: Be aware that when you unwrap multiple optionals at once, you can't identify which contains nil.\n\nUnwrap Multiple Optionals with Guard\nOf course, we should use guard over else-if.\nfunc unwrapWithGuard() {\n  guard let name = publicName, let photo = publicPhoto, let age = publicAge else {\n    // if one or two of the variables contain \"nil\"\n    print(\"Something is missing\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  print(\"Your name is \\(name). I see your, \\(photo). You are \\(age).\")\n  // Animation Logic\n  // Networking\n  // More Code, but still zen\n}\n\nDefer Statement\n\nDefer Statement: Put off (an action or event) to a later time; postpone.\n\nA defer block only executes only after current scope (loop, method, etc) exits.\nfunc simpleDefer() {\n  defer { print(\"Chill, later\")  }\n  print(\"Print First\")\n}\n\nLet us execute the simpleDefer() function.\nsimpleDefer()\n// \"Print First\"\n// \"Chill, later\"\n\nAnother example,\nfor i in 1...3 {\n  defer { print (\"Deferred \\(i)\") }\n  print (\"First \\(i)\")\n}\n\n// First 1\n// Deferred 1\n// First 2\n// Deferred 2\n// First 3\n// Deferred 3\n\nUsage Case for Defer\n\nExecuting completion handler blocks which you will learn in Chapter 3.  \nAny code you want to explicitly inform your team without requiring them to read the entire function\n\nSource Code\n1003_guard_defer_statement.playground\nConclusion\nIn this lesson, you've learned the power of guard over typical else-if.  First, it provides an early exit. Second, no one has to read the entire function to spot the error messages. You use a guard statement not just to please yourself, but for the sake of your teammates' falling hair when he/she reads your code. Keep guarding, everyone. Don't defer your learning, however.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/intro-error-handling.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/intro-error-handling.html","title":"Intro to Error Handling","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Error Handling\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 4, Intro to Error Handling, of The Swift Fundamentals. I feared Error Handling. I thought I had to be a professional debugger to fully utilize the feature. However, one day, I discovered, again. It's nothing more than writing an else-if block to send and deal with the error messages you've designed on your own. The built-in features of Error Handling since Swift 2.0 allow you to write cleaner, modular, and readable code.\nProblem\n\nHow do you warn your co-workers the function may result unexpected outcomes?\nWhat is a do-try block?\nHow do you distinguish between try?, try!, and try?\n\nDesign Safety Feature\nDesign a safety check for riders based on height. If the passenger is taller than 2m or below 1.4m, the program will send error messages along with other instructions.\nfunc checkHeight(height: Int) {\n  if height > 200 {\n    print(\"You are going to hit your head and fall off\")\n    // Take him/her off from the ride\n    // Code ...\n    // Seatbelt tighten\n\n  } else if height \nProblem with Else-If alone\n\nBloated function\nLack of modularity\nUncertainty\n\nError Handling\nError Handling is just additional way to write an else-if statement to not only deal with the error messages but also respond after them in a separate block.\nDesign Error\nCreate an enum that conforms to the Error protocol. Determine a few cases.  \nenum HeightError: Error {\n  case maxHeight\n  case minHeight\n}\n\n\nAny type that declares conformance to the Error protocol can be used to represent an error in Swift’s error handling system. Because the Error protocol has no requirements of its own, you can declare conformance on any custom type you create.\n\nDesign Throwable Function\nCreate a function that can throw/return errors by inserting throws at the end of the function parameter. The function does not contain error messages. Instead, it \"throws\" an error which will be \"caught\" and handled in a separate block with do-try.\nfunc checkHeightError(height: Int) throws {\n  if height > 200 {\n    throw HeightError.maxHeight\n  } else if height \nCall and Handle Error\nTo call a function that contains throws, the function requires try within a do block. A catch block is used to recognize and the error thrown by the function. If there is no error thrown, the catch block is ignored.\ndo {\n  try checkHeightError(height: 240)\n} catch HeightError.maxHeight {\n  print(\"Get out of here\")\n  // Logic\n} catch HeightError.minHeight {\n  print(\"Too short to ride\")\n}\n\nError Handling with Object Initialization\nDesign Error\nenum NameError: Error {\n  case noName\n}\n\nDesign Throwable Class\nWhen the user enters an empty string when initializing, the init method throws NameError.noName.\nclass Course {\n  var name: String\n\n  init(name: String) throws {\n    if name == \"\" {\n      throw NameError.noName\n    } else {\n      self.name = name\n      print(\"You've created an object!\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nInitialize and Handle Error\nCreate an object using try within a do-catch block.\ndo {\n  let myCourse = try Course(name: \"\")\n} catch NameError.noName {\n  print(\"Error: please make sure enter name!\")\n  // Logic\n}\n\nDistinguish Between try?, try!, and try\ntry is only used within a do-catch block. However, try? and try! can be used without it.\n\nYou may get away using try without a do-try block within Playground, but it is not allowed in anywhere else.\n\ntry?\nIt returns an optional type. If it throws an error, the result will be nil.\nlet newCourse = try? Course(name: \"Bob the Dev\") // returns Course?\nlet newDopeCourse = try? Course(name: \"\") // nil\n\ntry!\nIt returns a normal type. If the method/init throws an error, it will crash.\nlet myNewCourse = try! Course(name: \"Bobby Lee\") // &#x1F44D;\nlet myDopeNewCourse = try! Course(name: \"\") // ☠️\n\nSource Code\n1004_intro_error_handling.playground\nResources\nIntro to Error Handling by Bob the Developer\nConclusion\nYou've learned the Swift Error Handling syntax such as catch, do, and try. To recap, you may only use try within a do-catch block to execute a throwable method. However, you may also use try? and try! alone. Again, avoid using! in most cases since it will break your program. If you wish to review or feel stuck, I've attached an additional article for you to study as well.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn the final usage of ! and ? in the Swift Programming Language through type castingwhich allows you to convert types that are made up of classes and possibly with structs. &#x1F914;\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/type-casting.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/type-casting.html","title":"Type Casting","keywords":"","body":"Type Casting\nIntroduction\nWelcome to lesson 5 of The Swift Fundamentals with Bob. You've learned a number of ! and ? since Lesson 1. These are language features that distinguish Swift from the rest, and you've got to know all, when, where, how, and, most importantly, why.\nIn this lesson, you learn how to convert types in objects that are created with classes and structs. In fact, if you use Storyboard in iOS, you must know type casting.\nProblem\n\nHow do you distinguish between as, as?, as!?\nWhy does Xcode keep telling me what to do?\n\nType Casting in UIKit\nYou might have seen,\nimport UIKit\nlet label = UILabel() as UIView\n\nYou've converted UILabel to UIView. UILabel is a subclass of UIView. Let us attempt to replicate the phenomenon with custom classes.\n The UIKit framework hierarchy\nHuman Class\nDesign a class called, Human that contains a single method.\nclass Human {\n  func introduce() {\n    print(\"Hi, I'm a human\")\n  }\n}\n\nHuman Subclass\nDesign Korean and Japanese which inherit from the Human class.\nclass Korean: Human {\n  func singGangNamStyle() {\n    print(\"Oppa Gangnam Style\")\n  }\n}\n\nclass Japanese: Human {\n  func doNinja() {\n    print(\"Shhh.....\")\n  }\n}\n\nCheck if all good\nlet bob = Korean()\nbob.introduce() // \"Hi, I'm a human\"\nbob.singGangNamStyle() // \"Oppa Gangnam Style\"\n\nType Casting\nYou may convert Korean to Human or vice versa. There are two ways: upcasting and downcasting.\nUpcasting\nUpcasting occurs when an object converts its type to the base class. In the early above, you've upcasted UILabel to UIView using as.\n\nThe word \"up\" aligns with the structure in the graph above.\n\nlet newBob = bob as Human  // Korean -> Human\nnewBob.introduce()\nnewBob.singGangNamStyle() // Does not exist\n\nUpcasting Example in Swift Struct\nvar name = \"Bob\" as Any\nvar number = 20 as Any\nvar anyArray = [name, number] // [Any]\n\n\nI forgot to mention that Int and String are struct types which lack base classes. However, structs may only \"upcast\" to Any.\n\nDowncasting\nDowncasting is the opposite. You may downcast Any to String. However, it may fail since Any could contain many types. Analogous to optionals, there are two ways to downcast: Force downcasting or Implicit downcasting\nForce Downcasting\nIt does not return an optional type.  but if it fails, it crashes.\n// Force Downcasting\nlet newValue = anyArray[0] as! String\nlet newValue = anyArray[1] as! String // Error\n\n\nDowncasting is only available only after upcasting.\n\nImplicit Downcasting\n It returns an optional type. If it fails, it returns nil.\nlet newNewValue = anyArray[0] as? Int\nprint(newNewValue) // Optional(20)\n\nType Casting in Practice\nCreate Instances\nlet shion = Japanese()\nlet lee = Korean()\nlet kenji = Japanese()\nlet park = Korean()\n\nCreate Array Using Upcasting\n let humans: [Human] = [shion as Human, lee as Human, kenji as Human, park as Human]\n\nAutomatic upcasting\nlet humans: [Human] = [shion, lee, kenji, park]\nlet humans = [shion, lee, kenji, park]\n\nLoop\nfor human in humans {\n  if let korean = human as? Korean {\n    korean.singGangNamStyle()\n  }\n\n  if let japanese = human as? Japanese {\n    japanese.doNinja()\n  }\n}\n\nUsage in iOS Development\nTypecasting can be used to group UI Components and add attributes as a whole.\nimport UIKit\n\nlet loginButton = UIButton()\nlet loginMessage = UILabel()\nlet loginView = UIView()\n\nlet UIComponents = [loginButton, loginMessage, loginView]\n\nfor component in UIComponents {\n  if let button = component as? UIButton {\n    // Change background color\n    // Add Title\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  if let label = component as? UILabel {}\n  if let view = component as? UIView {}\n}\n\n\nImportant: Upcasting is not a recommended practice since there is a better way to go about: Protocol Oriented Programming. I mention drawbacks of using type casting through comparison in Chapter 3 and 5.\n\nAnother Example\nTo fetch a view controller from Storyboard, downcast to identify the designated view controller.\nlet storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: \"Main\", bundle: nil)\nlet vc = storyboard instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"VC\")\n// type of vc = UIViewController\nlet vc = storyboard instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: \"VC\") as! VC\n// type of vc = VC\n\nSource Code\n1005_type_casting.playground\nReference\nAnyObject and Any in Swift (Stack Overflow)\nConclusion\nI lied. I said type casting allowed to convert types in classes. However, you may also convert Int and String to Any even though they are made up of structs, not classes.\nUnnecessary type casting is not recommended among iOS developers because it causes a massive headache from casting back and forth. There is an alternative to go about. You will learn how to group objects together through Protocol Oriented Swift in Chapter 3. I know you are excited. Learn fast, but stay patient and consistent.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn how to design reusable code through generics. You will come out dry, not wet, a.k.a we enjoy typing.  \n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/generics.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/generics.html","title":"Intro to Generics","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Generics\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 6 of The Swift Fundamentals with Bob. When you think of the word, \"generic\", what makes you think? Well, I'm sure you've thought of versatile code. What? Don't you dare worry. I will walk you through. Remember, the number one goal is to write as little as possible, but produce as much.\nProblem\nI smell something.\n\nFor the reference, read more about code smell\n\nAccess Elements\nLet us reflect on how we rolled in the past.\nlet highSchoolGPA = [2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.8, 3.5]\nlet favoritePeople = [\"Elon Musk\", \"Steve Jobs\", \"Kevin O'leary\"]\nlet favoriteNumbers = [3, 20]\n\nThe Worst way to access elements\nhighSchoolGPA[0]\nhighSchoolGPA[1]\nhighSchoolGPA[2]\n\nLoop and Print\nThis is slightly better.\nfunc printDoubleElement(array: [Double]) {\n  for GPA in array {\n    print(GPA)\n  }\n}\n\nfunc printStringElement(array: [String]) {\n  for person in array {\n    print(\"I love \\(person)\")\n  }\n}\n\nfunc printNumberElement(array: [Int]) {\n  for number in array {\n    print(\"I like \\(number)\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nNeedlessly many functions. It goes against the DRY principle.\n\nIntroducing Generics\nA generic function allows you to pass any value regardless of types.   \nfunc genericFunction(value: anything) {\n  print(value)\n}\n\nfunc genericFunctions(value: WHATEVER) {\n  print(value)\n}\n\nSwift infers the type of anything or WHATEVER based on the input.\ngenericFunction(value: \"Bob\")  // anything is String\ngenericFunctions(value: true)    // WHATVER is Bool\n\nGeneric Loop\nLet us create a generic function.\nfunc printElement(array: [T]) {\n  for element in array {\n    print(element)\n  }\n}\n\nCall the function\nprintElement(array: highSchoolGPA) // 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, ...\nprintElement(array: favoritePeople) // 'Elon Musk\", \"Steve Jobs\", ...\n\n\nGeneric code enables you to write flexible, reusable functions, classes, enums, protocols, and structs subject to requirements that you define.\n\nNow only you can create generic functions, but also generic classes and structs. Let us begin with a non-generic struct.\nNon-Generic Struct\nCreate a Family struct that contains members whose type is [String]. Add a method that appends to the array.\nstruct Family {\n  var members = [String]()\n\n  mutating func push(member: String) {\n    members.append(member)\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The mutating keyword is added to function of enum and struct that mutates its own property/properties.\n\nNon-Generic Instance\nvar myFam = Family()\nmyFam.push(member: \"Bob\")\nmyFam.members // [\"Bob\"]\n\nThe struct above only works with String. Some families may have names in Int. Then, you must create a new struct. It goes against the DRY principle.\nGeneric Struct\nstruct genericFam {\n  var members = [T]()\n\n  mutating func push(member: T) {\n    members.append(member)\n  }\n}\n\nInstead of using WHATEVER or anything, T is a standard among iOS developers.\nDefine Type Explicitly\nNow, let us create an object from the generic struct. You have to specify the type based on the rule in Lesson 1.\nvar myGenericFamily = genericFam()\nmyGenericFamily.push(member: \"Bobby\")\n\nvar genericFamily = genericFam()\ngenericFamily.push(member: 123)\n\nDefine Type Implicitly\nHowever, the type can be inferred based on the input.\nlet myHappyFamily = genericFam(members: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  // T becomes Int\n\nGeneric Extension\nYou may add an extension to generics for more features. Let us grab the first element in the members property.\nextension genericFam {\n  var firstElement: T? {\n    if members.isEmpty {\n      return nil\n    } else {\n      return members[0]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet geekFamilyMember = genericFam(members: [\"Bob\", \"Bobby\"])\nlet firstElement = geekFamilyMember.firstElement // \"Bob\"\n\nType Constraints \nSo far, you could enter any value to define T. But, you may restricts the type you only want to interact with.\nFirst, design two classes.\nclass LOL {}\nclass BabyLol: LOL {}\n\nNow, let's create a function that only allows you to enter LOL.\nfunc addLOLClassOnly(array: [T]) { }\n\nWhen you run the addLOLClassOnly function, you can't add anything besides whose type is LOL.\naddLOLClassOnly(array: [LOL(), LOL(), LOL(), BabyLol()])\naddLOLClassOnly(array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) // Error\n\n\nImportant: BabyLol() has been automatically upcasted to LOL.\n\nResources\nIntro to Generics in Swift with Bob\nSource Code\n1006_generics.playground\nConclusion\nYou now understand how to maintain yourself dry through generic functions and structs.

Second, you will discover why structs do not provide inheritance.\nProblem\n\nWhat are the differences besides inheritance?\nWhen to use structs over classes?\n\nDesign Class\nTo demonstrate the difference between classes and structs, first design a class, HumanClass that has a name property.\nclass HumanClass {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Instance\nvar humanClassObject = HumanClass(name: \"Bob\")\nhumanClassObject.name // \"Bob\"\n\nCreate another instance that \"copies\" humanClassObject\nlet newHumanClassObject = humanClassObject\n\nChange the name property of newHumanClassObject to \"Bobby\".\nhumanClassObject.name = \"Bobby\"\nnewHumanClassObject.name // \"Bobby\"\n\nThe name property of newHumanClassObject has been changed to \"Bobby\" as well.\nDesign Struct\nLet us find out if the same behavior occurs with an object created with structs\nstruct HumanStruct {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Instance\nCreate another instance that \"copies\" structObject\nvar structObject = HumanStruct(name: \"Bob\")\nlet newStructObject = structObject\n\nChange the name property of structObject to \"Bobby\".\nstructObject.name = \"Bobby\"\nnewStructObject.name // \"Bob\"\n\nOn the contrary, the change on the name property of structObject has no effect on newStructObject.name.\n The graph below shows the fundamental difference between value types vs reference types.\n The difference in value type and reference type\nClasses\nFor classes, when you create an instance that \"copies\", the new instance shares the object with the original instance.\nlet newHumanClassObject = humanClassObject // share\n\nStructs\nFor structs, when you create an instance that \"copies\", the new instance creates an identical copy of the object, and the object is not shared.\nlet newStructObject = structObject // copy-paste\n\nMutability\nDue to the fundamental difference, there is an interesting discrepancy when it comes to creating instances with let.\nMutability in Classes\nLet us create an instance with let and attempt to mutate its property.\nclass BobClass {\n  var name = \"Bob\"\n}\n\n// Create Instance\nlet bobClass = BobClass()\nbobClass.name = \"Bobby\"\n\nlet newBobClass = bobClass\n\nnewBobClass.name = \"Bob the Developer\"\nbobClass.name // \"Bob the Developer\"\n\nAlthough the instance, bobClass has been created with let, the property of it has been mutated.

Instances with classes have references to the object while withstructs store. As a result, classes are called reference types while structs and enums, are value types.\nAt this point, you may find no incentive to learn the difference. You are right. For small apps, it doesn't matter. But, once you start implementing closures and delegates, and other reference related tasks,  you would soon discover a little more complexity which you will learn how to solve in Chapter 5.

There are two objectives. The first is to learn how to group a list of items with sets. The second is to work with various types within a single variable/constant with tuples.\nProblem\n\nI'd love to eliminate duplicated items: sets\nI'd love to combine all kinds of types: tuples\n\nIntroducing Sets\nA set stores values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering and no duplicated elements.\nMultiple Ways to Create Arrays\nBefore we create sets in Swift, let's review multiple ways to create an array.\n\nRemember, Array is just a generic struct.\n\nvar arrayOne: [Double] = [] // Most Common\nvar arrayTwo = [Double]()\n\nvar arrayThree: Array = []\nvar arrayFour: Array = Array()\nvar arrayFive = Array([1123.08, 234.23])\n\nvar arraySix = Array(1...100)\nvar arraySeven = Array(repeatElement(\"Bob\", count: 10))\n\n\nRemember, Set is just a generic struct.\n\nMultiple Ways to Create Sets\nSet in Swift looks similar to Array.\nvar setOne: Set = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nvar setTwo: Set = [\"Bob\", \"Bobby\", \"Bob the Developer\"]\nvar emptySet = Set()\n\nBuilt-In Set Methods\nSimilar to Array, Set contains default methods and properties.\nemptySet.insert(\"Bob\")\nemptySet.contains(\"Bob\") // true\nemptySet.remove(\"Bob\")\n\nCreate Two Arrays\nYou may convert Array to Set, or vice versa. In this example, let us convert Array to Set. First, create two arrays filled with odd and even numbers.\nvar oddNumbers: [Int] = []\nvar evenNumbers: [Int] = []\n\nfor number in 1...50 {\n  if number % 2 == 0 {\n    evenNumbers.append(number)\n  } else {\n    oddNumbers.append(number)\n  }\n}\n\nTernary Operator\nYou may use ternary operator as an alternative to achieve the same result above. You will learn more in 1011_intro_operators  \nfor number in 1...50 {\n  (number % 2 == 0) ? evenNumber.append(number) : oddNumber.append(number)\n}\n\nCheck\noddNumbers // [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...]\nevenNumbers // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...]\n\nConvert Array to Set\nvar oddNumberSet = Set(oddNumbers)\nlet evenNumberSet = Set(evenNumbers)\n\noddNumberSet and evenNumberSet no longer has defined order.\nBuilt-In Set Methods\nSet provides methods to work with multiple sets.\n Built-in Set methods\nUnion\noddNumberSet.union(evenNumberSet)\n\nSymmetric Difference\noddNumberSet.symmetricDifference(evenNumberSet)\n\nIntersection\noddNumberSet.intersection(evenNumberSet)\n\nSubtract\noddNumberSet.subtract(evenNumberSet)\n\nvar numberSet = Set([1, 2, 3])\nlet secondNumberSet = Set([1, 2])\n\nnumberSet.subtract(secondNumberSet)\nprint(numberSet) // {3}\n\nSubtract mutates oddNumberSet. Therefore, the oddNumberSet instance must be var rather than let. You can predict whether a method is mutating or not based on the naming guide below.\nSwift Naming Guide\n\n\n\nMutating\nNon-Mutating\n\n\n\n\nverb\nadjective\n\n\narray.append()\narray.sorted()\n\n\narray.sort()\narray.appending\n\n\n\nSort\nSince sets do not provide any order, sets must be converted to an array type to be sorted. There is a built-in method called, sorted().\nlet sortedArray = evenNumberSet.sorted()\nprint(sortedArray) // [2, 4, 6, ...]\n\nFunctional Programming\nThe sorted() is flexible.\nlet sortedArrayFromHighToLow = evenNumberSet.sorted { $0 > $1 }\nprint(sortedArrayFromHighToLow) // [100, 98, 96, ...]\n\nIn this course, you are not going to learn how sorted() is constructed. However, if you are interested in learning more about Functional/Reactive Programming with RxSwift and MVVM, you can be on the mailing list for my upcoming courses.\nPractical Usage of Set\n\nFinding unique letters and unique visitors\nAny game logic (Up to your imagination)\n\nIntroducing Tuples\nYou may combine multiple types of value in a single let or var.\nlet firstScore = (name: \"Bob\", score: 9)\n\nYou may access elements through calling the index similar to Array\nfirstScore.0 // \"Bob\"\nfirstScore.1 // 9\n\nYou may also access the elements through the labels.\nfirstScore.name // \"Bob\"\nfirstScore.score // 9\n\nHowever, you don't have to specify the argument labels.\nlet secondScore = (\"Rob\", 10)\nsecondScore.0\nsecondScore.1\n\nPractical Usage\nThis is your past.\nlet httpFailure: [Any] = [401, \"Fail\"]\n\nYou no longer have to upcast to Any.\nlet httpSuccess = (code: 200, description: \"success\")\nhttpSuccess.code\n\nBonus Tips\nYou created multiple instances in a single line.\n// Okay\nvar dog = \"dog\", cat = \"cat\"\nprint(dog)\n\nInstead, you may use tuple\n// Better\nvar (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3)\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\n\nYou may convert an array into a tuple that contains index and element through the enumerated() method.\nvar shoppingList = [\"Eggs\", \"Milk\", \"Rice\"]\n\nfor (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {\n  print(index, value)\n}\n\nSource Code\n1009_set_tuple.playground\nReference\nSwift API Design Guidelines\nConclusion\nTo recap, Set is used to group non-duplicate items with no order. Tuple is used to group all kinds of types with the order you define.  Second, you've learned how to identify mutating vs non-mutating methods based on the naming guide. Make sure you follow the same principle in your codebase as well. Don't get too caught up with Functional Programming. I know it sounds cool.

If you do not know how to work with computed properties, you may visit 2002_computed_property and come back after.\n\nCheck\nCreate an object called bob.\nlet bob = Bob()\nbob.description // I'm Bob, I know work\"\n\nYou may use init(enterSkill: String) from the extension block.\nlet newBob = Bob(enterSkill: \"Drawing\")\nnewBob.description // I'm Bob, I know drawing\"\n\nExtend Swift Native Types\n\nRemember, Int just a struct\n\nInstead of creating a separate function, you may extend Int and add a property.\nextension Int {\n  var squared: Int {\n    return self * self\n  }\n}\n\nNow, objects whose type is Int, contain the squared property.\nlet myNumber = 10 // self is 10\nmyNumber.squared // 100\n\nThe Rule\n\nYou may not have a stored property within extension.\n\nThe Scope\nAs mentioned, extension allows developers to implement all kinds of features.\n\nAdd computed instance properties and computed type properties (2002_computed_property)\nDefine instance methods and type methods (2007_type_property_method)\nProvide new initializers\nDefine subscripts (1007_subscripts)\nDefine and use new nested types with enum/struct\nMake an existing type conform to a protocol\n\nSource Code\n1010_extension.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned the meaning of self.  I use extension to modularize view controller to prevent MVC, a.k.a, Massive View Controller.\nIn Chapter 4, you will learn the sheer power of extension along with protocols If you are interested in learning how to build apps with Protocols and best practices that I know of, you may join the VIP list for the upcoming course: The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob.\n"},"course/swift-fundamentals/intro-operators.html":{"url":"course/swift-fundamentals/intro-operators.html","title":"Intro to Operators","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Operators\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 11 of The Swift Fundamentals.

You may use an operator to achieve the same effect.\niCanDrink ? print(\"You may enter\") : print(\"No no\") // \"No no\"\n\nThe statement above states, if iCanDrink is true, print(\"You may drinK\"), else, print(\"No no\").\nAdd odd/even numbers\nIn Lesson 9, we created odd and even arrays.\nvar evenNumbers: [Int] = []\nvar oddNumbers: [Int] = []\n\nfor number in 1...50 {\n  if number % 2 == 0 {\n    evenNumbers.append(number)\n  } else {\n    oddNumbers.append(number)\n  }\n}\n\nTertiary Operator\nSince there are only two conditions, a tertiary operator is used instead.\nfor number in 1...50 {\n  (number % 2 == 0) ? evenNumbers.append(number) : oddNumbers.append(number)\n}\n\nUnwrapping Optionals\nYou may unwrap optionals without using if-let. You may use a good old way.\nvar age: Int? = nil\nvar defaultAge: Int = 20\n\nvar finalUserAge = Int() // 0\n\nif age != nil {\n  finalUserAge = age!\n} else {\n  finalUserAge = defaultAge\n}\n\nNeedlessly complex.\nNil-Coalescing Operator\nLet us type less but produce more.\nfinalUserAge = age ?? defaultAge // finalUserAge is 20\n\nThe above states that if age contains nil, use defaultAge instead. Nice and simple.\nSource Code\n1011_operators.playground\nConclusion\nYou've only scratched the surface. In Chapter 10, you will learn how to create your own operators. I know you are excited.

Object Oriented Programming is at the heart of the iOS ecosystem. We, developers, have no choice but to follow the platform created by Apple engineers. Therefore, one must know well about Object Oriented Programming.\nThe primary focus of this chapter is to understand how the platform utilizes OOP to produce modular code base. You will learn fundamentals principles such as singleton, type property, and convenience init to step your game. I've designed this chapter to be practical so that you may start using what you've learned in each lessons right in your current projects.\nWe will continue to focus on producing dry and quality code so that no longer feel a lack of confidence when you were asked to reveal your code.

You will learn how to become lazy.  In other words, you become smarter and effective when it comes to initializing an object. In programming, getting lazy to write less code is in fact good for your teammates and users as long as it's readable and gets the job done. Bill Gates once mentioned, whenever there is hard work to be done, he assigns it to the laziest person as he or she is sure to find an easy way of doing it.\nProblem\nI'm lazy. Can we initialize quickly?\nCreate Class with Designated Init\nCreate a class called Human\nclass Human {\n  var name: String\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n }\n\n  // Convenience init intializes the designated init method\n  convenience init() {\n    self.init(name: \"Bob Lee\")\n  }\n}\n\nConvenience init initializes the designated init method by calling self.init.\nCreate Object\nlet lee = Human(name: \"Bob Lee\") // init(name: String)\nlet bob = Human() // Convenience init()\n\nInitialize UIColor\nCreate an instance that stores UIColor.\nimport UIKit\n\nlet randomColor = UIColor(colorLiteralRed: 255/255, green: 80/255, blue: 85/255, alpha: 1)\n\nCustom Convenience Init\nCreate our own convenience init that initializes the designated init by adding extension to UIColor.\nextension UIColor {\n convenience init(r: Float, g: Float, b: Float) {\n   self.init(colorLiteralRed: r/255, green: g/255, blue: b/255, alpha: 1)\n }\n}\n\nlet myFavoriteColor = UIColor(r: 255, g: 80, b: 85)\n\nApplication\n\nQuick initialization for open source projects\nCustom convenience inits with UIKit\n\nSource Code\n2001_convenience_init.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to become lazy and effective at the same time. Imagine, you are the owner of a library for your teammates. They no longer have to use the bloated designated init method. Instead, you may provide multiple convenience init methods so that their lives become easier. It is similar to how the Apple engineers have provided us with convenience init methods for UIColor. It's a win-win situation.\nIn the next lesson, you will learn how to fail initializations.\n"},"course/object-oriented-swift/computed-property.html":{"url":"course/object-oriented-swift/computed-property.html","title":"Computed Property","keywords":"","body":"Computed Property\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Lesson 2 of Object Oriented Swift. You will learn how to create relationships between variables. You no longer have to manage two or more variables separately. You probably have seen get and set before. If you haven't, don't you worry. I will walk you through by placing your feet on mine.\nProblem\nDo we have to make functions all the time to calculate something?\nAtrocious Code\nUnrelated functions that take up many lines. The functions below are used to calculate a radius and diameter.\nfunc getDiameter(radius: Double) -> Double {\n return radius * 2\n}\nfunc getRadius(diameter: Double) -> Double {\n return diameter / 2\n}\n\ngetDiameter(radius: 10) // return 20\ngetRadius(diameter: 200) // return 100\ngetRadius(diameter: 600) // return 300\n\nThe two functions are separate and there is no relationship . Computed Property will help you solve this problem.\nIntroducing Computed Property\nYou may create a variable that only can be read. It is also referred to as a gettable property.\n\nComputed = calculated\n\nGettable Property\nCreate a only readable property.\nclass NumberClass {\n  var readableNumber: Double {\n    get {\n      // Complex logic\n      return 777\n    }\n  }\n  var readableNumbers: Double {\n    return 789\n  }\n}\n\nIf you attempt to modify the property, it will give you an error.\nreadableNumber = 10 // Error\nreadableNumbers = 20 // Error\n\nGettable and Settable Property\nYou may not only make a property gettable, but also settable by inserting set right after get.  Let us create a relationship between radius and diameter.\nvar radius: Double = 10\nvar diameter: Double {\n  get {\n    return radius * 2\n  }\n  set {\n    radius = newValue / 2\n  }  \n}\n\nnewValue refers to the newly set value of diameter.  For example, when you set diameter to 100,  newValue becomes 100.\ndiameter = 50\nradius = 100\ndiameter // 200\n\nInstead of calling newValue, you may add a different name. In the example below, there is a relationship between area and side. Instead of calling newValue, let us use newArea.\nimport Foundation\n\nvar side: Double = 100\nvar area: Double {\n get {\n   return side * side\n }\n set(newArea) {\n   side = sqrt(newArea)\n }\n}\n\nThere is a relationship between side and area.\narea = 1000\nside // 31.6\n\nApplications\n\nGrabbing and storing data the server\nPropagating relationships between properties\nPreventing others from manipulating your code\n\nSource Code\n2002_computed_property.playground\nConclusion\n You've learned what it means to create a gettable property that can be only read. You've also learned how to create a settable property which allows you to modify its value as well as those of others. The UIKIt framework often utilizes gettable properties to prevent us, developers, from modifying them.\nIn the lesson lesson, you will learn how to add an observer to a property.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

You are going to learn how to add an observer to a property so that you may track when it is mutated or anything happens.\nProblem\nHow can I add observer/tracker to a property?\nwillSet and didSet\n\nwillSet is called just before the value is set\ndidSet is called immediately after the new value is set to the property.\n\nGrade Tracker\nvar myGrade: Int = 80 {\n  willSet(newGrade) {\n    print(\"About to change your grade to \\(newGrade)\")\n  }\n  didSet {\n    print(\"Your grade has been changed\")\n    print(\"you had \\(oldValue) previously.

Now you have 100\"\n\nThe willSet block is called before myGrade is set to 100. The didSet block runs only after. oldValue refers to the initial value.\nStep Counter\nCreate a variable called, totalSteps. When the variable encounters a new value, you may notify the user that the value has been changed.\nvar totalSteps: Int = 20 {\n  willSet(newTotalSteps) {\n    print(\"About to set totalSteps to \\(newTotalSteps)\")\n  }\n  didSet {\n    if totalSteps > oldValue  {\n      print(\"Added \\(totalSteps - oldValue) steps\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ntotalSteps = 60\n// \"About to set totalSteps to 60\"\n// \"Added 20 steps\"\n\nApplication\nYou may notify the user or change background color once the user successfully logs in to the app.\nvar userLoginInfo: Bool = false {\n  willSet(newValue) {\n    print(\"The user has tried something\")\n  }\n  didSet {\n    if userLoginInfo {\n      print(\"The user has switched from \\(oldValue) to \\(userLoginInfo)\")\n      // Backgroud color\n      // Animation\n      // Pop Up\n      // All kinds of stuff\n  }\n }\n}\n\nuserLoginInfo = true\n// The user has tried something\n// The user has switched from false to true\nuserLoginInfo = true\n// The user has tried something\n// The user has switched from true to true\n\nSimilarity with Computed Property\n\nAlways recalculated even if the value has not changed.\n\nWhat makes Property Observers different\n\nThere is a default value and it is observed rather than calculated.\nwillSet and didSet will not get called when you initialize it.\n\nSource Code\n2003_property_observers.playground\nConclusion\nThe purpose of using property observers is not only to write less code but also to provide greater readability through the distinctive keywords.

As we've discussed many times, anything that has to do with ? in the Swift Programming Language will give you an optional value. Second, you reviewed the Swift error handling approach. Remember, the throw keyword is not only used within an else-if or guard block, but also within an init method.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to override everything while subclassing.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

Super.init?\nExample from UIViewController\nYou might have seen something like this below.\nimport UIKit\n\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {\n  override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    print(\"Hello\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The viewDidLoad() method runs automatically by the UIViewController class.\n\nMany wonder what super and override stand for. Let us find out.\nCreate Vehicle Class\nCreate a class called Vehicle. It contains one gettable property and one method.\nclass Vehicle {\n  var description: String {\n    return \"Hello, I'm moving at 30km/hr\"\n  }\n\n  func warning() {\n    print(\"Be careful, I'm going pretty fast\")\n  }\n}\n\nOverride Method and Property\nCreate a class called, ToyCar, and inherit Vehicle. You may customize inherited properties and methods by inserting override.  You may access inherited properties and methods by calling super.\nclass ToyCar: Vehicle {\n  override var description: String {\n    return \"\\(super.description) hey, I'm a cute car\"\n  }\n\n  override func warning() {\n    print(\"hello, don't mind me\")\n    super.warning()\n  }\n}\n\nNow, let us access the description property and the warning method of ToyCar.\nlet myFutureCar = ToyCar()\nmyFutureCar.description\n// \"Hello, I'm moving at 30km/hr hey I'm a cute car\"\nmyFutureCar.warning()\n// \"hello, don't mind me\"\n// \"Be careful, I'm going pretty fast\"\n\nSuper Init\nYou may override an init method from the super class. Remember, every property must be initialized even the ones from the super class.\nDesign Super Class\nCreate a class that contain a property called, origin.\nclass Human {\n var origin: String\n\n init(enterOrgin: String) {\n   origin = enterOrgin\n }\n}\n\nDesign Subclass\nCreate a subclass, called Korean that inherits from Human. The Korean class contains a property called, name.  However, when you initialize, you must initialize the origin property from the Human class by calling super.init.\nclass Korean: Human {\n  let city: String\n\n  init(enterCity: String) {\n    self.city = enterCity\n    super.init(enterOrgin: \"Korean\")\n  }\n\n  init(enterCity: String, origin: String) {\n    self.city = enterCity\n    super.init(enterOrgin: origin)\n  }\n}\n\nCreate Object\nThere are two init methods in the Korean class. You may choose any since both initialize the origin property from the Human class.\nlet bob = Korean(enterName: \"Bob the Dev\")\nlet bobby = Korean(enterName: \"Bob the Dev\", myOrigin: \"Korean\")\n\nOverride Init\nNot only you may override methods and properties, but also init methods.\nDesign Base Class\nDesign a class called, Tesla. It contains a property called, numberOfWheels.\nclass Tesla {\n  var numberOfWheels: Int\n\n  init(enterWheelNumber: Int) {\n    numberOfWheels = enterWheelNumber\n  }\n}\n\nDesign SubClass\nDesign a called, ModelS that inherits Tesla.

You may override class func introducing(), but you may not override final func cantOverride(). final prevents Classes from overriding.\nclass Parent: GrandParent {\n  override class func introducing() {\n    print(\"I'm married for 5 years\")\n  }\n//  override static func introduce() {\n//    print(\"I'm married for 5 years\")\n//  }\n}\n\nParent.introducing() // \"I'm married for 5 years\"\n\nPractical Usage\nYou may store a list of items.\nstruct BluetoothID {\n struct iPhone {\n   static let iPhone4 = \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\n   static let iPhone5 = \"7867-5676-4535-1235\"\n   static let iPhone6 = \"3938-6738-1424-9876\"\n   static let iPhone7 = \"4845-3148-1237-1296\"\n   static let iPhone8 = \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n }\n}\n\nBluetoothID.iPhone.iPhone8 // \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\nBluetoothID.iPhone.iPhone8 // \"\"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n\nAlternative\nYou may also use enum.\nenum AirDropID: String {\n case iPhone4 = \"4234-1232-1232-5465\"\n case iPhone5 = \"7867-5676-4535-1235\"\n case iPhone6 = \"3938-6738-1424-9876\"\n case iPhone7 = \"4845-3148-1237-1296\"\n case iPhone8 = \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n}\n\nAirDropID.iPhone8.rawValue // \"7967-8123-7892-4563\"\n\nSource Code\n2007_type_property.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to access properties and methods without creating an object. When you work structs, you may only have static type. When you work classes, however, you may have static and class type. If you wish to prevent any property from being overridden, you may use the final keyword.\nWhen you start taking The UIKit Fundamentals with Bob, you will discover the beauty of static methods and properties.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to create the only object that exists everywhere.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

I took courses from Udemy, Lynda, Treehouse, and YouTube. However, there wasn't a single course that the instructor challenged herself to explain closures despite wide usage. As a result, including myself, students often turn into code monkeys. They simply copy off from the screen and Stack Overflow answers.\nFirst, let me ask you a question. Have you heard about completion handlers. If you had any experience with networking with database, such as Facebook Login, you have. But, do you know how to design one? Do you know how to initialize objects using closures? Do you know the difference between escaping and autoclosures? Do you know what it means to capture self?\nWhen I learned Swift as my first programming language, I had a tough time understanding closures. As I've been blogging for a while, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine.  It took me 3 months to completely understand closures. I don't expect you to be comfortable with closures just by taking a couple lessons with me. However, your time to mastery will dramatically decrease because you are here with me.\nAs much as I want to this chapter to be digestible, I have to admit it. It is not easy. The process is analogous to riding a bicycle for the first time. Your parents might be able to give you a little push from the back. At the end of the day, you are the one paddling and succeeding. Expect you will fall from the bicycle many times.

You will learn what makes closures different from the Swift functions. If you've never used closures before, this lesson will be tough.\nProblem\nWho are you closures, () -> ()?\nDefinition\n\nA closure is a function without name and the func keyword (for now).\nQuick and easy to carry around as a variable/constant or pass as a parameter\n\nFunctions\nTo appreciate closures, let us begin with functions. Create a function that add two numbers.\nfunc addTwoNumbers(number1: Int, number2: Int) -> Int {\n  return number1 + number2\n}\n\nFirst Class Citizen\nYou may store a function into a variable/constant.\nvar addFunction = addTwoNumbers\naddFunction(10, 30) // 40\n\nIntroducing Closures\nCreate a closure whose functionality is identical as above. A closure block begins and ends with {,}.\nvar addClosures: (Int, Int) -> Int = {\n  (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  return number1 + number2\n}\n\naddClosures(4, 10) // 14\n\nThe type of  addClosures is (Int, Int) -> Int. It is identical to addTwoNumbers from the early example. number1 and number2 are the parameter labels. Anything comes after  the keyword,in, is a return block.\nShort Form\nIt is not required to enter return after in only if the closure solely returns value.\nvar addClosuresTwo = {\n  (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  print(\"Hello\")\n  return number1 + number2 // return required\n}\n\nvar addClosuresThree = {\n  (number1: Int, number2: Int) in\n  number1 + number2 // return not required\n}\n\naddClosuresThree(4, 6)\n\nThe addClosuresTwo requires return since there is an additional line of print(\"Hello\"). Besides, you may skip the return keyword.\nShortest Form\nAs long as you specify the type, you may not create an argument label.\nvar addClosuresFour: (Int, Int) -> Int = { $0 + $1 }\naddClosuresFour(4, 5) // 9\n\nIn the example above, $0 and $1 refer to the first and second parameter.    Swift recognizes 4 as $0 and 5, $1 from addClosuresFour(4, 5).\nAnother Example\nLet us create a function that does not require any parameter but returns String.\nfunc callString() -> String {\n  return \"hello, I'm a function\"\n}\n\nLet us express the callString function with a closure block instead.\nlet callStringWtihClosure: () -> String = { () in\n  print(\"hello\")\n  return \"hello, I'm a closure\"\n}\n\ncallStringWtihClosure()\n// \"hello, I'm a closure\"\n\n// Skip Return\nlet callStringWtihClosureTwo: () -> String = { () in\n  \"hello, I'm a closure\"\n}\n\nShort Form \nIf you pass no parameter, you may ignore explicit type definition.\n// Type defined explicitly\nlet callStringWtihClosureThree: () -> String = { \"hello, I'm a closure\" }\n\n// Type defined implicitly\nlet callStringWtihClosureFour = { \"hello, I'm a closure\" }\ncallStringWtihClosureFour // () -> String\n\nResource\nNo Fear Closure in Swift 3 with Bob\nSource Code\n3001_intro_closures_part1.playground\nConclusion\nTo recap, you've learned functions and closures are identical. However, you may express closures using various forms which often lead to zenness and effective communication. You've learned the basics. You will discover the power of closures as you step up one at a time.\nYou may feel uncomfortable. You should be. In fact, if you are not struggling, you are not learning. Accumulating knowledge goes against the Second Law of Thermodynamics that the universe wants to remain scattered. When you defy the law as a human being, you face consequences. Embrace the pain and it's a natural phenomenon.\nIn the following lesson, you will how learn how to pass and return a closure block within a function.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

There are two objectives. The first is to learn how to initialize an object using a closure block. The second is to understand when, where, how, and why we use the lazy keyword in the Swift Programming Language.\nProblem\nHow to initialize an object with a closure?\nUnconventional Way\nIf you've followed tutorials online or looked through open source projects, it's not uncommon to initialize UI components with the following way.\nimport UIKit\n\nlet box: UIView = {\n  let view = UIView()\n  return view\n}()\n\nHowever, a lot of students fail to explain because they simply copy.\nCreate UI Components\nTo appreciate the unconventional method, let us begin the \"normal\" way to create UI components programmatically.\nlet buttonSize = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100)\n\n// ViewControllerOne\nlet bobButton = UIButton(frame: buttonSize)\nbobButton.backgroundColor = .black\nbobButton.titleLabel?.text = \"Bob\"\nbobButton.titleLabel?.textColor = .white\n\n// ViewControllerTwo\nlet bobbyButton = UIButton(frame: buttonSize)\nbobbyButton.backgroundColor = .black\nbobbyButton.titleLabel?.text = \"Bobby\"\nbobbyButton.titleLabel?.textColor = .white\n\nIt is tedious.\nCreate Button with Function\nYou may create a function instead.\nfunc createButton(enterTitle: String) -> UIButton {\n  let button = UIButton(frame: buttonSize)\n  button.backgroundColor = .black\n  button.titleLabel?.text = enterTitle\n  return button\n}\ncreateButton(enterTitle: \"Yoyo\")\n\nHowever, when you build apps, it is unlikely that buttons look identical. Therefore, the function may require multiple parameters for customization. It becomes more tedious and readability decreases.\nIntroducing Unconventional Way\nThe unconventional way uses a closure block to initialize an object.\nCreate Object with Closure\nFirst, let us figure out how to create an object using a closure block.\nDesign a Human struct\nstruct Human {\n  init() {\n    print(\"Born 1996\")\n  }\n}\n\nCreate an instance called, bobInstance.\nlet createBob = { () -> Human in\n  let human = Human()\n  return human\n}\n\nlet bobInstance = createBob()\n\nYou've created two constants: createBob and bobInstance. Unnecessary.\nInitialize in Single Line\nlet bobby = { () -> Human in\n  let human = Human()\n  return human\n}()\n\nNow, bobby contains the human object.\nCreate UIView Unconventionally\nLet us apply the same principle to creating a UIView object.\nlet bobView = { () -> UIView in\n  let view = UIView()\n  view.backgroundColor = .black\n  return view\n}()\n\nlet bobbyView = { () -> UIView in\n  let view = UIView()\n  view.backgroundColor = .black\n  return view\n}()\n\nThe closure block has no parameter. Therefore, you no longer have to define the type explicitly - 3001_intro_closures_part1\nlet newBobbyView: UIView = {\n  let view = UIView()\n  view.backgroundColor = .black\n  return view\n}()\n\nYou only have to define the type of newBobbyView as UIView.\nIntroducing Lazy Var\nThe lazy keyword is used in front of a variable.\nclass IntenseMathProblem {\n  lazy var complexNumber: Int = {\n    1 * 1\n  }()\n}\n\nlazy properties are not initialized until you access them.\nlet problem = IntenseMathProblem() // no value for complexNumber\nproblem.complexNumber // now, complexnumber is 1\n\nApplication\nYou may use lazy to sort your database.\nclass SortFromDataBase {\n  // Data\n  lazy var sortNumberFromDatabase: [Int] = {\n    // Caluation and sorting\n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n  }()\n}\n// SortFromDataBase().sortNumberFromDatabase\n\nYou do not want to sort your entire database. It would burn a lot of computing power.\nThe same principle applies to image compression.\nclass CompressionManager {\n  lazy var compressedImage: UIImage = {\n    let image = UIImage()\n    // Compress the image\n    // Logic\n    return image\n  }()\n}\n\nRules\n\nYou can’t use lazy with let since there is no initial value, and it is attained later when it is accessed.\nYou can’t use it with a Computed property since computed property is always recalculated (requires CPU) when you modify any of the variables that has a relationship with the lazy property.\nlazy is only valid for members of a struct or class\n\nResources\nSwift Lazy Initialization with Closures\nSource Code\n3003_lazy_init_closures.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to initialize an object using closures instead of the tedious method above. I do not use Storyboard. In fact, I have a \"library\" of UI Components so that I don't waste time typing all day. I just copy the closure block from the library and modify a little. Second, you've learned to use the lazy keyword in front of a property that requires heavy computing.\nIn the following lesson, you will discover a unique behavior of closures.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

Today, you will discover a unique behavior of closures, and how to make it right.\nDiscovery Stage\nFirst, let us create two variables.\nvar a = 0\nvar b = 0\n\nDesign Closure\nCreate a closure block which prints a and b.\nlet newClosure = { print(a, b) }\nnewClosure() // (0, 0)\n\nDesign Closure Array\nCreate an array whose type is [() -> ()]. newClosure will be added to closureArray.\nvar closureArray: [() -> ()] = []\nvar i = 0\n\nAppend Closure\nLet us add multiple closure blocks to the array using a for-in loop.\nfor _ in 1...5 {\n  closureArray.append {\n    print(i)\n  }\n  i += 1\n}\n// i is 5 by now\n\nExecute Closure\nLet us call the function.\nclosureArray[0]() // 5 &#x1F632;\nclosureArray[1]() // 5 &#x1F914;\nclosureArray[2]() // 5 &#x1F628;\nclosureArray[3]() // 5 &#x1F62D;\nclosureArray[4]() // 5 &#x1F631;\n\nYou might have expected each element to print, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. However, each closure uses the final value of i which is 5 at the end of the loop.\n\nImportant: A closure block is  a reference type. You will learn more in Chapter 5.\n\nCharacteristic of Closure\nLet us dig deeper.\nDesign Closure\nvar c = 0\nvar d = 0\n\nlet smartClosure: () -> () = { _ in\n  print(c, d)\n}\n\nFirst, modify the value of c and d. Second execute the closure.\nc = 9\nd = 9\nsmartClosure() // (9, 9)\n\nsmartClosure() prints (9, 9). When the value of c and d mutate, the change is reflected on the closure by default.\nIntroducing Capture List\nLet us destroy the default behavior.\n\nStrategy: Do not reference. Copy\n\nAdd an array [a, b] before in. The array is referred to as a capture list.\nlet smarterClosure: () -> () = { [c, d] in\n  print(c, d)\n}\n\nsmarterClosure() // (9, 9)\n\nNow , attempt to modify the value of c and d\nc = 10\nd = 10\n\nExecute smarterClosure. You will discover that the change is not reflected on the closure anymore.\nsmarterClosure() // (9, 9)\n\nThe capture list \"copies\" the value of c and d at the particular time the closure was created. It become invincible.\nDestroy Unique Behavior\nLet us go back to the early example with the for-in loop to append the closure block to the array.\nDesign Closure\nvar smartClosureArray: [() -> ()] = []\nvar j = 0\n\nAppend Closure\nCapture j\nfor _ in 1...5 {\n  smartClosureArray.append { [j] in\n    print(j)\n  }\n  j += 1\n}\n\nYou may rebrand j. In this case, I will refer to j as num within the closure block.\nfor _ in 1...5 {\n  smartClosureArray.append { [num = j] in\n    print(num)\n  }\n  j += 1\n}\n\nExecute\nLet us find out whether you've killed the default behavior.\nsmartClosureArray[0]() // 0 ☝️\nsmartClosureArray[1]() // 1 &#x1F4AA;\nsmartClosureArray[2]() // 2 &#x1F381;\nsmartClosureArray[3]() // 3 &#x1F389;\nsmartClosureArray[4]() // 4 &#x1F385;\n\nResources\nCapture List in Closures\nSource Code\n3004_capture_lists.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned the default behavior of a closure block which is identical to that of instances created with class objects.

In this lesson, the goal is to master the protocol syntax before you take full advantage of what it offers on the table.\nProblem\nProblem: Protocols, who are you?\n\nAnalogy: Protocol is like a basketball coach. He/she tells players what to do, but he/she doesn't know how to dunk.\n\nDrawbacks of OOP\nBefore implementing protocols, you should be aware of drawbacks from solely relying on OOP.\n\nWhen you subclass, you have to inherit properties and methods which you may not need. The object becomes unnecessarily bloated.\nWhen you make a lot of super classes, it becomes extremely hard to navigate between each class and fix bugs/edit.\nSince objects are referencing to the same place in memory, if you make a copy and create a small change its property, it can mess up the rest. (Mutability due to reference)\n\nDesign Protocol\nCreate a protocol called, Humanable. It contains two properties and one method. Do not worry about get and set for now.\nprotocol Humanable {\n  var name: String { get set }\n  var race: String { get }\n  func sayHi()\n}\n\nCreate a class that conforms to Korea just like how you would subclass. To prevent Swift from screaming, you must implement two properties and one method defined in the protocol.\nstruct Korean: Humanable {\n  var name: String = \"Bob Lee\"\n  var race: String = \"Asian\"\n  func sayHi() {\n    print(\"Hi, I'm \\(name)\")\n  }\n}\n\nclass American: Humanable {\n  var name: String = \"Joe Smith\"\n  var race: String = \"White\"\n  func sayHi() {\n    print(\"Hi, I'm \\(name)\")\n  }\n}\n\nProtocol Inheritance\nA protocol may \"inherit\" the requirements from other protocols.\nprotocol SuperHumanable: Humanable {\n  var canFly: Bool { get set }\n  func punch()\n}\n\nAny classes, structs, enums that conform the SuperHumanable must contain properties and methods from Humanable as well.  \nstruct BobtheDeveloper: SuperHumanable {\n  var name: String = \"Bob\"\n  var race: String = \"Asian\"\n  func sayHi() {\n    print(\"I code\")\n  }\n\n  var canFly: Bool = false\n  func punch() {\n    print(\"I don't punch\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: { get } or { get set } only apply to computed property. If a class has a stored property, you may choose either { get } or { get set }.\n\nComputed Property\nWhen a class/struct/enum contains computed properties, you must take into account of { get } or { get set } while setting the requirements of a protocol.\nCreate a protocol called, Breathable. It contains two properties: isBreathing and isLiving.\nprotocol Breathable {\n  var isBreating: Bool { get set }\n  var isLiving: Bool { get }\n}\n\nCreate a struct that conforms to Breathable. The struct contains properties: isBreathing and isLiving. Define them as computed properties.\nstruct Human: Breathable {\n  var isBreating: Bool {\n    get { return true }\n    set {}\n  }\n\n  var isLiving: Bool {\n    get { return true }\n    set {}\n  }\n}\n\n\nRule: When you set the requirement as { get } you may make the property gettable or settable. If it is defined as { get set }, you must define the property as settable.\n\n\n\n\n{ get }\n{ get set }\n\n\n\n\nStored Property &#x1F600;\nStored Property &#x1F600;\n\n\nComputed Property --> Gettable, Settable (Optional)\nComputed Property --> Gettable, Settable (Must)\n\n\n\nSource Code\n4001_intro_protocols.playground\nReferences\nAll evidence points to OOP being bullshit by John Barker \nIf you're subclassing, you are doing it wrong by Hector Matos\nConclusion\nFor stored properties, it does not matter whether you use { get } or { get set }. For computed properties, however, if you define the requirement as { get set }, the property must be settable. If it is { get } alone, the property can be gettable or settable. Remember, protocol is like a basketball coach. structs, enums, classes, are like players.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to create a scalable architecture with protocol extension, a.k.a, the magic.    \n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

You might have heard about the delegate pattern. Perhaps, you've seen, tableView.delegate = self. I've discovered a lot of developers have no idea how to explain what goes underneath. They just simply copy and paste as if it just works. In fact, I was one of them for solid 6 months when I first started learning iOS. Today, however, you are with me, Bob the Developer.\nDo not worry about its vague terminology, called \"delegate\".  This is a pattern that is used to communicate or send data between objects that are created with classes and structs. That's it. With that in mind, let me explain this magic for you.\nProblem\nHow does delegate even work?\n\nPurpose of Delegate: Communicate/Pass Data between objects\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to send data from FirstVC to SecondVC using the delegate pattern.\nDesign Protocol\nCreate a protocol called, PassDataDelegate. It contains a method that takes data whose type is in String.\nprotocol PassDataDelegate {\n  func passData(data: String)\n}\n\nDesign Delegator (Sender)\nCreate a class that contains an optional property whose type is PassDataDelegate?.\nclass FirstVC {\n  var delegate: PassDataDelegate?\n}\n\nIf you call the method, passData of the property, delegate, it will return nil since you have not initialized delegate.\nFirstVC().delegate?.passData(data: \"Bob\") // nil\n\nDesign Delegate (Receiver)\nCreate SecondVC that conforms to PassDataDelegate.  SecondVC must contain passData(data: String) due to the protocol.\nclass SecondVC: PassDataDelegate {\n  func passData(data: String) {\n    print(\"The CEO gave me \\(data)\")\n  }\n}\n\nCreate instances\nlet firstVC = FirstVC()\nlet secondVC = SecondVC()\n\nSet firstVC.delegate to secondVC. It is possible since secondVC conforms to PassDataDelegate because Swift Protocol can be used as one's type.\nfirstVC.delegate = secondVC\n\nWhen you set the relationship as above, you may call the passData method that resides in the secondVC object from the firstVCobject.\nAssign Delegate\nfirstVC.delegate = secondVC\nfirstVC.delegate?.passData(data: \"A bunch of contracts\")  \n// \"The CEO gave me a bunch of contracts\"\n\nIn the example above, firstVC is calling the passData method and it passes data, called, \"A bunch of contracts\". When it occurs, the full implementation of the method that resides in secondVC get called. Thus, the print function is also get executed.\nUITableView in ViewController\nimport UIKit\n\nclass BobViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDelegate {\n  let tableView = UITableView()\n\n  override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    tableView.delegate = self\n  }\n\n  func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {\n    print(tableView)\n    // Hey BobViewController/Delegate, do something with the data I've given you\n    // Download Image...\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nIn the example above, tableView is the delegator/sender/CEO, while the object of  BobViewController is the delegate/receiver/Secretary. The method, func tableView(_talbeView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath), is called by the tableView. Yet, the full implementation is executed within the BobViewController object.\nSource code\n4004_delegate.playground\nResources\nThe Complete Understanding of Delegate and DataSource\nIntroduction to Delegate in Swift\nConclusion\nYou've learned the delegate pattern is used to pass data between objects. In fact, you've learned how to pass data fromFirstVC to SecondVC in one direction. Simply put, you've learned passing data from the CEO to the secretary. In the following lesson, you will learn that you can also send data backward, the secretary to the CEO using data source. You will find out.\nIf you have not grasped the concept of delegate, I recommend you to ask questions on Udemy, Slack, or any other platforms. I've also attached additional articles for you to take a look at. You've got to know the principle because in the next course, you will learn how this pattern is to communicate between iOS, the operating system, and us, developers.\n"},"course/protocol-oriented-swift/datasource.html":{"url":"course/protocol-oriented-swift/datasource.html","title":"Data Source","keywords":"","body":"Data Source\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the last lesson of Protocol Oriented Swift. In the previous lesson, you've learned how to pass data from the CEO to the secretary. In this lesson, you will learn how to pass data from the secretary to the CEO. Lastly, you will learn how the datasource pattern is used within the iOS ecosystem using UITableView.  It's not much different from the previous lesson. Let's get started.\nProblem\nCan the CEO hear from the Secretary?\nPurpose\n\nPurpose of Data Source: Communicate (Backward) from SecondVC(delegate) to FirstVC(delegator)\n\nIt is also a part of the delegate pattern. Do not get caught up with the name, \"data source\". Just follow me along.\nDesign Protocol\nprotocol PassDataDelegate {\n  func passData(data: String) -> String\n}\n\nThere is only one difference. The passData method return String. You will find out how everything works together.\nDesign Delegator (Sender/CEO)\nclass FirstVC {\n  var delegate: PassDataDelegate?\n}\n\nFirstVC().delegate?.passData(data: \"a bunch of contracts\") // nil\n\nDesign Delegate (Receiver/Secretary)\nclass SecondVC: PassDataDelegate {\n  func passData(data: String) -> String {\n    print(\"The CEO gave me \\(data)\")\n    return \"I'm too tired...\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe SecondVC object contains a method passData. Unlike the previous tutorial, the method now returns String.\nCreate Objects\nlet firstVC = FirstVC()\nlet secondVC = SecondVC()\n\nEverything is the same.\nAssign Delegate\nfirstVC.delegate = secondVC\n\nExecute the Method\nHere is the difference.\nlet message = firstVC.delegate?.passData(data: \"a bunch of contracts!\")\nprint(message!) // \"I'm too tired\"\n\nThe firstVC object now hears \"I'm too tired\" which is an implementation by the secondVC object.\nPractical Examples in iOS\nLet us find out how the return part is used within the iOS ecosystem.\nimport UIKit\n\nclass BobViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource {\n  var tableView = UITableView()\n  override func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    tableView.dataSource = self\n  }\n\n  func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {\n    return 2000\n  }\n\n  func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {\n    return UITableViewCell(style: .default, reuseIdentifier: \"cell\")\n  }\n}\n\nThe BobViewController object must contains two methods which are numberOfRowsInSection and cellForRowAt. The object must return Int and UITableView to the tableView object. The tableView object then uses the data received from the BobViewController object to generate its UI and all sorts of things we developers have no idea since the UIKIt framework ain't open sourced.\nSource code\n4004_delegate.playground\nResources\nThe Complete Understanding of Delegate and DataSource\nIntroduction to Delegate in Swift\nConclusion\nWhen you first started this lesson, you must have thought data source must be something extraordinary and difficult. Not at all. It is still a part of the delegate pattern, yet it is nothing more than a method that returns. For the naming purpose, if you think the secretary must talk to the CEO, then call the secretary as the ~datasource. If not, just name it as ~delegate. If you've completed understood the delegate pattern with me, great job.

You will learn the definition of the term \"memory\" in the context of the Swift Programming Language. By the end, you will understand how objects are initialized and destroyed by the operating system.\nProblem\nDeallocate and allocate objects with ARC\nWhat is Memory\nThere are primarily two places to store data: 1. RAM or 2. Hard Disk. The term \"memory\" refers to management of space of RAM.\n RAM is like a fridge\nWhen an object is initialized, it is physically stored on RAM. Since the space is limited, the object should be removed when unused. The process is known as deallocation. You will learn how to deallocate objects using ARC, Automatic Reference Counting.\nDesign Passport\nCreate a class called, Passport. It contains two properties whose types are Human?and String. The Human class defined below.\nclass Passport {\n  var human: Human?\n  let citizenship: String\n\n  init(citizenship: String) {\n    self.citizenship = citizenship\n    print(\"\\(citizenship) passport generated\")\n  }\n  deinit {\n    print(\"I, paper, am gone\")\n  }\n}\n\nDesign Human\nCreate a class called, Human.  It contains two properties whose types are Passport? and String.\nclass Human {\n  var passport: Passport?\n  let name: String\n\n  init(name: String) {\n    self.name = name\n    print(\"\\(name) generated\")\n  }\n\n  deinit {\n    print(\"I, \\(name), gone\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The deinit block runs automatically when the object no longer exists on its RAM.\n\nCreate Instances\nLet us create an object without var or let.\nPassport(citizenship: \"Republic of Korea\")\n// \"Republic of Korea passport generated\"\n// \"I, paper, am gone\"\n\nIronically, the Passport object has been deallocated immediately after initialized. Let us create a variable that has a reference to Passport.\nvar myPassport = Passport(citizenship: \"The Mars\")\n// \"The Mars passport generated\"\n\nThe Passport object is not deallocated. The phenomenon is due to Automatic Reference Counting. If an object has a reference, it stays. Conversely, there is no reference, the object gets deallocated automatically.\n\nThe Only Rule: If the reference count reaches zero, the object is deallocated.\n\nCreate Instances\nCreate two instances one with Human and the other one with Passport.\nvar bobby: Human? = Human(name: \"Bobby\")\nvar passport: Passport? = Passport(citizenship: \"Republic of Korea\")\n\nLet us visualize the relationship.\n\nDeallocate\nYou may set the relationship as nil.  \nbobby = nil // deallocated\npassport = nil // deallocated\n\n\n\nImportant: When you set the variable as nil, you destroy the reference, not the object itself. The object is deallocated usually since the reference count reaches zero.\n\nDiscover Retention Cycle\nHowever, we do not live in an ideal world. Even if you set the reference as nil, the object may stay in the RAM forever.\nCreate Instances\nCreate two instances: bob and myPassport.\nvar bob: Human? = Human(name: \"Bob\")\nvar myPassport: Passport? = Passport(citizenship: \"Republic of Korea\")\n\nCreate a relationship between the instances\nbob?.passport = myPassport\nmyPassport?.human = bob\n\nLet us visualize the relationship\n\nThe Human object has two references from bob and Passport. The Passport object has two references from myPassport and Human.\nDeallocation\nLet us set the relationship from bob and myPassport as nil. However, it is not deallocated.\nbob = nil // Human not deallocated\nmyPassport = nil // Passport not deallocated\n\n\nThe Human object's reference count is one from the Passport object. The Passport object's reference count is one from the Human object. There is no way to deallocate both of them. The current situation is called, retain cycle or memory leak.\nSo solve the problem, you may set one of the relationship as weak which does not increase the reference count.\nclass Passport {\n  weak var human: Human?\n  let citizenship: String\n}\n\n\nCurrently, the Human object has one reference count from bob only since the weak reference does not increase the reference count.\nDeallocation\nLet us attempt to deallocate the objects.\nbob = nil  \n// \"I, Bob, gone\"\n\nThe Human object is deallocated since the reference count reaches zero.\n\nYou may destroy the Passport object\nmyPassport = nil\n// \"I, paper, am gone\"\n\n\n\nImportant: There is no such thing as retain cycle in structs and enums.\n\nSource Code\n5001_intro_memory_management.playground\nResources\nMake Memory Management Great Again\nConclusion\nFirst, you've learned the definition of Memory Management in the concept of the Swift Programming Language. Always think about the fridge as well as the sour milk. You only want foods that are nice and fresh. Second, when you set the variable as nil, it does not mean destroying the object. It means removing the reference.  Last, it's all about the reference count. Make it zero if you wish to deallocate.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn a possible retain cycle that might occur when you use the delegate pattern. Make sure you review the previous lesson before proceed.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

You will discover a potential retain cycle that might occur while using the delegate pattern.\nProblem\nWhy delegate should be weak var\nDesign Delegate Pattern\nLet us create a classic structure: the protocol, the delegator, and the delegate.\nDesign Protocol\nprotocol SendDataDelegate {}\n\nDesign Sender/Delegator\nclass SendingVC {\n  var delegate: SendDataDelegate?\n\n  deinit {\n    print(\"Delegator gone\")\n  }\n}\n\nDesign Receiver/Delegate\nclass ReceivingVC: SendDataDelegate {\n  lazy var sendingVC: SendingVC = {\n    let vc = SendingVC()\n    vc.delegate = self\n    return vc\n  }()\n\n  deinit {\n    print(\"Delegate gone\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The closure init method is used with the lazy keyword from 3003_lazy_init_closures. You may not interact with self while creating a brand new property since it is not initialized. However, lazy allows since the property is initialized only after self has been created.\n\nCreate Instances\nvar receivingVC: ReceivingVC? = ReceivingVC()\nreceivingVC?.sendingVC // lazy born\n\nLet us visualize the relationship.\n\nThere is a retain cycle. Even if you set recevingVC as nil, there is a reference count for both ReceivingVC and SendingVC from each other.\nreceivingVC = nil\n// not deallocated\n\nDeallocate\nMake one of the relationships/references as weak.\nclass SendingVC {\n  weak var delegate: SendDataDelegate?\n  ...\n}\n\nHowever, as soon as you work with weak which only applies to reference types, the compiler forces you to indicate the protocol as a different animal\nprotocol SendDataDelegate: class  {}\n\nLet us visualize the relationship.\n\nLet us deallocate\nreceivingVC = nil\n// \"Delegate gone\"\n\n\nNotice that the SendingVC object also has been deallocated since it no longer has a reference from the ReceivingVC object.\nRules\n\nA weak reference allows the referencing object to becoming nil (this happens automatically when the referenced object is deallocated)\nBased on the rule above, the referencing object/variable must be optional\n\nSource Code\n5002_delegate_retention_cycle.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to spot a retain cycle within the delegate pattern. You may wonder which variable should be set as weak. The #1 rule is, a weak property has a reference to a class object which more likely to stays longer, and eventually has greater importance. For example, if the SendingVC object has a weak reference from the recevingVC property, the object will be deallocated immediately since the reference count is zero.\nIn the following lesson, you will discover the pitfall of using closures due to the unique behavior you've learned in Chapter 3, 3004_capture_lists\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

From the previous lesson, however, you must be careful using references due to retain cycle.\nProblem\n\nHow to use capture lists to prevent retain cycle in closures\nWhen to use unowned\n\nDesign Class\nFirst, create a called, BobClass. It has two properties, bobClosure and name whose types are (() -> ())? and String.\nclass BobClass {\n  var bobClosure: (() -> ())?\n  var name: String = \"Bob\"\n\n  init() {\n    bobClosure = { print(\"Bob the Developer\") }\n  }\n\n  deinit {\n    print(\"Bobclass gone\")\n  }\n}\n\nLet us call the closure.\nvar bobClass: BobClass? = BobClass()\nbobClass?.bobClosure!()\n// \"Bob the Developer\"\n\nLet us visualize the relationship.\n\nThe closure block is separate from the BobClass object.  The bobClosureproperty has a reference to the closure block.\nSince the BobClass object as one reference from the bobClass property, you may deallocate the object.\nbobClass = nil\n// \"Bobclass gone\"\n\nLet us visualize.\n\n\nImportant: Notice the closure block has been also deallocated due to the reference count of zero.\n\nRetain Cycle\nLet us create a reference from the closure block.\nclass BobClass {\n  var bobClosure: (() -> ())?\n  var name: String = \"Bob\"\n\n  init() {\n    bobClosure = { print(\"\\(self.name) the Developer\") }\n  }\n\n  deinit {\n    print(\"Bobclass gone\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The self refers to the object created by BobClass.\n\nNow, let us deallocate.\nbobClass = nil\n// Not deallocated\n\nLet us visualize the relationship to see the retain cycle.\n\nThere is a retain cycle between the BobClass object and the closure block.\nSolution\nThere are two ways.\nWeak\nThe first way is to use a weak var. The closure should have a relationship as shown by the image below.\n\nTo achieve the result above, you must use capture lists. You will capture self as a weak reference.\nclass BobClass {\n  var bobClosure: (() -> ())?\n  var name: String = \"Bob\"\n\n  init() {\n    bobClosure = { [weak self] in\n      guard let object = self else {\n        return\n      }\n\n      print(\"\\(object.name) the Developer\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nHowever, the capture self within the closure has turned into an optional type. Let us review the rule of weak.\n\nA weak reference allows the referencing object to becoming nil (this happens automatically when the referenced object is deallocated)\nBased on the rule above, the referencing object/variable must be optional\n\nUnowned\nYou may capture self, as a non-optional type with unowned. Like weak, it does not increase the reference count.\nclass BobClass {\n  var bobClosure: (() -> ())?\n  var name: String = \"Bob\"\n\n  init() {\n    bobClosure = { [unowned self] in\n      print(\"\\(self.name) the Developer\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nunowned states that the closure block must have a non-nil reference to the BobClass object. If the object is deallocated, it will cause a runtime error analogous to force-unwrapping nil.\n\nMore Unowned\nOne example is not enough.\nDesign Independent Class\nCreate a class called Owner. It contains a property whose type is CreditCard?.\nclass Owner {\n  var creditCard: CreditCard?\n  deinit { print(\"Owner gone\") }\n}\n\nDesign Dependent Class\nCreate a class called CreditCard. It contains a non-optional property whose type is Owner.\nclass CreditCard {\n  unowned let owner: Owner\n\n  init(enterOwner: Owner) {\n    owner = enterOwner\n  }\n\n  deinit { print(\"Card gone\") }\n}\n\nCreate Instances\nvar bob: Owner? = Owner()\nvar myCard = CreditCard(enterOwner: bob!)\nbob?.creditCard = myCard\n\nLet us visualize.\n\nLet us deallocate.\nbob = nil\n// \"Owner Gone\"\n\nIt works, since the Owner object has one reference from the bob property.\nWhen myCard attempts to access its unowned property of owner, however, scary stuff happens.\nmyCard.owner // Run-time Error\n\nBased on the definition of unowned, it must have a non-nil reference to the object. Since the Owner object has been deallocated, it crashes.\n\nIf self will never be deallocated before the closure block, use unowned. If you try to access the value of an unowned reference after that instance has been deallocated, you’ll get a runtime error.\n\nSource Code\n5003_closure_retention_cycle.playground\nResources\nSwift Retention Cycle in Closures and Delegate\nConclusion\nLet us recap. Like classes, closures are reference types, so you must be aware of retain cycle. To prevent one, you use capture lists to set the reference from the closure to self as weak or unowned. Remember, when you set the reference as weak, the closure captures self as an optional type because the closure must be able to break the reference. If you use unowned, however, the object or variable must have a non-nil reference. The relationship can't be broken as you've seen in the Owner and Credit card example. You may use unowned if you are certain that the referenced object will not deallocated before the referencing object. If not, it will cause a run-time error.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn one of the dreaded topics in closures: escaping and auotoclosures.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

You will learn at which circumstances you use escaping and autoclosures. No fear closures.\nProblem\nWhat are those?\nEscaping Closures\n\nDefinition: If the closure block is executed after the function returns, you must add @escaping.\n\nScenario 1\nCreate an array whose type is [() -> Void].\nvar closureBlocks: [() -> Void] = []\n\nCreate function whose parameter type is () -> Void. The function will take the parameter and append to the closureBlocks array.\nfunc funcWithClosure(closure: @escaping () -> Void) {\n  closureBlocks.append(closure)\n}\n\nThe @escaping keyword is added since the closure can be called after the function returns/executes.\nScenario 2\nAsynchronous operation does not execute code line-by-line. Instead, it runs many at the same time.\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc funcWithNetworkingClosure(closure: @escaping () -> Void) {\n  DispatchQueue.global().async {\n    closure() // Ex) downloading\n  }\n}\n\nThe @escaping is added automatically.\nWhen you pass a closure block to the function, the closure block is executed even after the function returns.\nfuncWithNetworkingClosure {\n  for _ in 1...1000 {\n    print(\"downloading\")\n  }\n}\n\n// \"downloading\"\n// \"downloading\"\n// ...\n// execute other operations\n// \"downloading\"\n// \"downloading\"\n// execute other operations\n\n\nNote: If you wish to learn more about multi-tasking and asynchronous operations,, you may read Intro to Grand Central Dispatch in Swift 3 with Bob\n\nNormal Function\nA normal function is @nonescaping by default. In other words, the closure is executed before the function returns/finishes.\nclass Normal {\n  let name = \"Bob\"\n\n  func normalFunctionWithClosure(closure: (String) -> Void) {\n    closure(self.name)\n  }\n}\n\nNormal().normalFunctionWithClosure { (myName) in\n  print(myName)\n}\n\nWhen you execute the function, the closure block is initialized and deallocated as the function returns. The function also gets deallocated. It happens almost simultaneously. If the function is @escaping, however, the closure block is not deallocated while the function block is.\nBenefits of Non-Escaping\n\nThere is no retain cycle for non-escaping functions since everything is deallocated\nYou may use self keyword without worrying about memory leak\nPerformance and the ability for the compiler to optimize\n\nIntroducing @autoclosures\nfunc checkIDCard(hasCard: () -> Bool) {\n  if hasCard() {\n    print(\"You've an ID\")\n  }\n}\n\ncheckIDCard(hasCard: { return true})\ncheckIDCard(hasCard: { true })\ncheckIDCard { true }\n\nThe @autoclosure keyword allows you to pass a closure block with no brackets.\nfunc checkIDCard(hasCard: @autoclosure () -> Bool) {\n  if hasCard() {\n    print(\"You've an ID\")\n  }\n}\n\ncheckIDCard(hasCard: true)\n\nLazy Init Capture\nYou've learned how to initialize an object with lazy and closures. However, you must be careful of potential retain cycle. Let us find out if there is one.\nCreate Lazy\nclass BobGreet {\n  var name = \"Bob the Developer\"\n\n  lazy var greeting: String = {\n    return \"Hello, \\(self.name)\"\n  }()\n\n  deinit {\n    print(\"I'm gone, bruh &#x1F646;‍\")}\n}\n\nThe closure block as a strong reference to self. However, let us attempt to deallocate regardless.\nDeallocate\nvar bobGreet: BobGreet? = BobGreet()\nbobGreet?.greeting\nbobGreet = nil // \"I'm gone, bruh &#x1F646;‍\"\n\n\nImportant: a closure block with a lazy property is @noescape by default.\n\nSource Code\n5004_escaping_autoclosures.playground\nResources\nIntro to Grand Central Dispatch in Swift 3 with Bob\nConclusion\nYou've learned 3 concepts. First, a function requires the @escaping keyword if the closure block in the parameter is executed after the function returns. Second, the @auotoclosure keyword is used to enter a closure block without brackets. However, the closure must have no parameters. Lastly, there is no retain cycle in lazy properties.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

In Lesson 1, class objects are automatically deallocated by the number of references. However, there are cases when objects are never deallocated. The situation is called retain cycle or memory leak. To solve this, you may use either weak or unowned reference to not increase the reference count of an object. In Lesson 2 and 3, you've learned how to create retain cycles in the delegate pattern and closures. Be aware when you use reference types over value types. In Lesson 4, you've learned how to distinguish between @escaping and @nonescape closures. A function requires closure in its parameter with the @escaping keyword only if it is executed at any point after the function returns. Swift functions are @nonescape by default. The closure is initialized, yet deallocated after the function returns.\nIn the following chapter, you will learn how to combine the best of the best to design a scalable and fantastic codebase, a.k.a, generic protocols. \n"},"course/functional-programming/introduction.html":{"url":"course/functional-programming/introduction.html","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 6\nFunctional Programming\nWelcome to Chapter 6, Functional Programming.

I've decided to dedicate this lesson for explaining what it means to look at or solve problems with a functional perspective. Let's begin.\nProblem\nWhat is functional programming\nDefinition\n\n“Functional Programming is a paradigm that allows you to make your code explicit. There is no state and no mutuality”  - What?\n\nMost bloggers begin with the statement above. However, it's a horrible sentence to bring up in the very beginning. Let's learn the statement above organically with me.\nNon-Functional Programming\nIn the past, to sum an array, you probably have used the approach below.\n// Somewhere in ViewController\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3]\nvar sum = 0\nfor number in numbers {\n  sum += number\n}\n\nIf you need to use the add functionality again, you probably have reused the code somewhere else.\n// Somewhere in NextViewController\nlet newNumbers = [4, 5, 6]\nvar newSum = 0\nfor newNumber in numbers {\n  newSum += newNumber\n}\n\nThe above examples are horrendous. It violates the DRY principle which we must serve. There is no need to create 5 lines of code which can be done just in a single line.\nFunctional Programming\nLet's begin the process. Let's create a function instead.\nfunc saveMeFromMadness(elements: [Int]) -> Int {\n  var sum = 0\n  for element in elements {\n    sum += element\n  }\n\n  return sum\n}\n\nNow, let's attempt to use the above function.\n// Somewhere in ViewController\nsaveMeFromMadness(elements: [1, 2, 3])\n\n// Somewhere in NextViewController\nsaveMeFromMadness(elements: [4, 5, 6])\n\nLook, now you only need to write two lines of code which required 10 lines. That's it.\n\nBob's Definition:  Functional programming is nothing more than using functions to derive results. No need to get fancy.\n\nUsage Case\nOne area that a functional paradigm is used in Excel's Spreadsheet functions. The functions are written probably written in the C# language. We simply use built-in functions to derive results.\n Excel Sum Function\nDeclarative: Functional\nSometimes, functional programming is described as declarative. In other words, the user does not care about the process. They only care about the result. For example, when my father is using Excel to manage the company's financial data, he doesn't care how the Sum function is written behind the scene. He simply uses the function.\nEx) Jump off from an airplane vs climb the mountain.\nImperative: Non-Functional\nIt tells you how you got the answer from A → B.\nEx) The for-in loop\nBenefits of Functional Programming\nA functional paradigm ensures no mutability or no change in state when used.\n\nModularity\nNo explicit state management\nFewer lines\nConventional communication\n\nSource Code\n5001_intro_functional_paradigm\nResources\nIntro to Swift Functional Programming\n10 Tips to become a better developer\nConclusion\nNow, I've demystified the concept of \"Functional Programming\" for you. Again, based on my simplest definition, it's nothing more than using functions to solve problems.\nIn the Swift Foundation library built by Apple Engineers, there are dozens of useful functions for us developers may use. However, as a developer, we've got to know the behind scene of each function. In the rest of the chapter, you will learn how those functions are created and you will be able to produce on your custom functions depending on your need. From now on, the lesson can get rough and tough, again, make sure you completely understand closures and generics before you jump in.  \n"},"course/functional-programming/filter.html":{"url":"course/functional-programming/filter.html","title":"Filter","keywords":"","body":"Filter\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the legit lesson of Functional Programming in Swift. As I've mentioned, there are a lot more than 4 functions besides filter, map, reduce, and flatmap in the functional programming world. However, the purpose isn't to memorize all. It is to understand what goes under the hood so that nobody has to become a zombie. Today, let's take a look at one popular function called, filter which is used to \"filter\" a group of objects.\nProblem\nHow to get things done with one line of code?\n\nNote: Most people use Swift functions without knowing the behind implementation\n\nImperative/Non-functional\nLet's attempt to grab even numbers using a non-functional approach.\n// Get even numbers\nvar evens = [Int]()\n\nfor i in 1...10 {\n  if i % 2 == 0 {\n    evens.append(i)\n  }\n}\n\nIt certainly works. But, you know what I'm about to say.\nDeclarative/Functional\nIf you remember correct, Array is just a struct and it contains built-in methods. filter is one of them. Let us utilize the filter function to get things done. You don't have to understand what goes under the hood at this point, but you will by creating our own custom filter function.\nArray(1...10).filter { (number) in number % 2 == 0 }\nArray(1...10).filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }\n\nLet us find out what the heck is going on. Don't you worry. As long as you are comfortable with closures and generics, you will get through with me.\nBecome an A Student\nMy mom used to love (still do since I'm in college) when I handed my grade sheet filled with \"A\"s. Let's find out how to only get \"A\" letters to please my mom.\nlet recentGrade = [\"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"D\"] // It can be any data\n\nImperative/Non-functional\nIn the past, you probably have done something like this as shown below.\nvar happyGrade: [String] = []\n\nfor grade in recentGrade {\n  if grade == \"A\" {\n    happyGrade.append(grade)\n  } else {\n    print(\"My mama not happy\")\n  }\n}\nprint(happyGrade) // [\"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\"]\n\nThe code above tells you the steps how you filtered recentGrade. This is long, boring, and confusing. You've created arbitrary instances such as happyGrade and grade which other developers must interpret. It consumes more calories which isn't good for executing a simple task.  \nFunctional Way\nFrom now on, you might find it difficult. Bear with me. First of all, let's create a function either returns true or false based on the parameter.\nCreate closure block that returns true/false\nvar isMomHappy: (String) -> Bool = { grade in return grade == \"A\" }\nisMomHappy = { $0 == \"A\" }\n\nisMomHappy(\"A\") // true\nisMomHappy(\"B\") // true\n\nCreate a function that take the closure block whose type is (String) -> Bool. I will call the parameter as operation.\nfunc simpleStringFilter(grades: [String], operation: (String) -> Bool) {\n  var happyGrade: [String] = []\n  for grade in grades {\n    if operation(grade) {\n      happyGrade.append(grade)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWithin the simpleStringFilter, the operation closure is executed. If operation returns true, append the grade to happyGrade.\nLet's execute simpleStringFilter.  The isMomHappy closure is passed  to the operation parameter.\nsimpleStringFilter(grades: recentGrade, operation: isMomHappy) // [\"A\", ...]\n\nThe entire function may also return [String]\nfunc stringFilter(grades: [String], operation: (String) -> Bool) -> [String] {\n  var happyGrade: [String] = []\n  for grade in grades {\n    if operation(grade) {\n      happyGrade.append(grade)\n    }\n  }\n  return happyGrade\n}\n\nExecute stringFilter.\nlet myGrade = [\"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"D\"]\nlet happyGrade = stringFilter(grades: myGrade, operation: isMomHappy)\nhappyGrade // [\"A\", ...]\n\nPass Closure Directly\nSo far, you've passed the closure block indirectly to the operation parameter using isMomHappy. However, you may directly enter a closure block. The syntax may look strange but I'm sure you are comfortable with closures at this point.\nstringFilter(grades: myGrade, operation: { element in return element == \"A\" })\nstringFilter(grades: myGrade, operation: { $0 == \"A\" })\n\nGeneric Function\nIf you remember from Chapter 1, intro to generics, it doesn't make sense to create a distinct function just for String only. Let us utilize the Swift generics.\nfunc bobFilter(array: [Bob], operation: (Bob) -> Bool) -> [Bob] {\n  var result: [Bob] = []\n  for element in array {\n    if operation(element) {\n      result.append(element)\n    }\n  }\n  return result\n}\n\nThe placeholder type of bobFilter is Bob which should be defined later. Usually, we use T instead.\nfunc myFilter(array: [T], operation: (T) -> Bool) -> [T] {\n  var result: [T] = []\n  for element in array {\n    if operation(element) {\n      result.append(element)\n    }\n  }\n  return result\n}\n\nExamples\nSo, let us find out how myFilter can be used.\nEx 1) Filter Numbers\nlet AStudent = myFilter(array: Array(1...100), operation: { $0 >= 93 && $0 \nEx 2) Vote Counting\nlet answer = [true, false, true, false, false, false, false]\nlet trueAnswer = myFilter(array: answer, operation: { $0 == true })\n\nThe rest is history. You can use your imagination from now on.\nYou may also utilize trailing closures to beautify.\nlet falseAnswer = myFilter(array: answer) { $0 == false }\n\nBuilt-in Swift Filter\nAs I mentioned earlier, Array comes with its own filter. Let us utilize. We don't have to reinvent.\nlet zeroToHund = Array(1...100)\nzeroToHund.filter{ $0 % 2 == 0 }.filter { $0 \nThe Purest Form\nThe built-in filter may look something like this. Since you have not taken generics protocols in the following chapter and Advanced Swift, you may be confused with Element. It's the type of an array for now.  \nextension Array {\n  func myFilter(_ logic: (Element) -> Bool) -> [Element] {\n    var result: [Element] = []\n    for item in self {\n      if logic(item) {\n        result.append(item)\n      }\n    }\n    return result\n  }\n}\n\nLet us test it out.\nlet result = Array(1...100).myFilter { $0 % 2 == 0 }\n\nSource Code\n6002_filter.playground\nResources\nIntro to Functional Programming\nConclusion\nCongratulations. You've learned what goes under the hood of filter, one of the most common functions. From now on, you understand what it means to pass a closure block at the end and you've learned how the closure block is used within the main function. This principle applies in every other major functions we will take a look at. Along with generics, it allows reusability, thus scalability in your code base.\nAt the end of the lesson, I've mentioned Element of an array. I don't expect you to know what it is. However, in the last chapter of this course, you will learn the behind scene by understanding the statement, \"Swift is a protocol oriented programming language\". Let's continue. \n"},"course/functional-programming/map.html":{"url":"course/functional-programming/map.html","title":"Map","keywords":"","body":"Map\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the second legit lesson of functional programming.

However, you may implicitly define the type of myType based on the value you assign to anyProperty.\nstruct SomeSturct: GenericProtocol {\n  var anyProperty = 1996 // myType = Int\n}\n\nstruct NewStruct: GenericProtocol {\n  var anyProperty = \"Bob\" // myType = String\n}\n\nDefine Associated Type with Typealias\nAs an alternative, you may define the type of myType explicitly by creating typealias.\nstruct ExplicitStruct: GenericProtocol {\n  typealias myType = Bool\n  var anyProperty = true  \n}\n\nSource Code\n6001_intro_associated_type.playground\nConclusion\nYou've learned how to create generic protocols by implementing associatedtype. Like generic structs, the type of associatedType must be defined by the structs, classes, or enums that conform to the protocol. There are two ways to specify the type of associatedType. You may implicitly define it based on the value you assign. Second, or you may explicitly create a typealias that define the type upfront.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to add limitation/constraints to protocol extension like generic constraints.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

Before you learn intermediate and advanced in later lessons, let us get everyone on the same page.\nProblem\nLet's Review\nTypes of Enumeration\n\nBasic Enumerations\nEnumerations that have Raw Values\nEnumerations that have Associated Values\n\nBasic Enumerations\nCreate an enum called Compass. It contains 4 cases.\nenum Compass {\n  case north\n  case south\n  case east\n  case west\n}\n\nYou define multiple cases in a single line\nenum Planet {\n  case mercury, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune\n}\n\nTo initialize, you choose one of the cases.\nlet earth = Planet.earth // init\n\nYou may run through a switch statement to identify the enum type.\nswitch earth {\ncase .earth:\n  print(\"Mostly safe\")\ndefault:\n  print(\"Not a safe place for me\")\n}\n\n// \"Mostly safe\"\n\nRaw Value\nAn enumeration may contain value. Swift supports the following types for the value of an enum:\n\nInt\nFloat\nString\nBool\n\nRaw Value: String\n enum Food: String {\n   case pizza\n   case banana\n   case chicken\n   case bigMac\n }\n\nlet stringValueFromPizza = Food.pizza.rawValue\nprint(stringValueFromPizza) // pizza\n\nRaw Value: Int\nenum Days: Int {\n  case mon, tue, wed, thu, fri = 10, sat, sun\n}\n// mon = 0, tue = 1, wed = 2, ... , fri = 10, sat = 11\n\nlet myDay = Days.fri.rawValue\nprint(myDay) // 10\n\nInitialization from Raw Value\nYou may create an enum object using a raw value. it may fail. Therefore, the returned object may be nil.\nlet possibleeDay = Days(rawValue: 10) // returns optional\nprint(possibleeDay!)\n\nYou may combine with a switch statement.\nif let someDay = Days(rawValue: 3) {\n  switch someDay {\n  case .sat, .sun:\n    print(\"Weekends!!\")\n  default:\n    print(\"Weekdays!\")\n  }\n} else {\n  print(\"No such day exists\")\n}\n\nAssociated Value\nEach case may contain value along with it.\nExample from Doc\nenum Barcode {\n  case upc(Int, Int, Int, Int)\n  case qrCode(String)\n}\n\nvar qrCode = Barcode.qrCode(\"XYZ\")\nvar upcCode = Barcode.upc(4, 2, 5, 5)\n\nValidation\nDetermine if the instance is Barcode.qrCode using an else-if statement. The process is similar to implicit unwrapping.\nif case let Barcode.qrCode(value) = qrCode {\n  print(\"This is a qrcode\")\n  print(value)\n}\n\nYou may capture the associated value of the instance, qrCode using case let. You've named the captured value as value.\nDetermine whether he upcCode instance is Barcode.upcCode.\nif case let Barcode.upc(numberSystem, manufacturer, product, check) = upcCode {\n  print(\"numbersystem:\", numberSystem)\n  print(\"manufaturer:\",manufacturer)\n  print(\"product:\",product)\n  print(\"check:\",check)\n}\n\nValidation with Switch Statement\nInstead of checking each enum object individually using an else-if, you may use a switch statement.\nlet code = upcCode\n\nswitch code {\ncase .upc(let numberSystem, let manufacturer, let product, let check):\n  print(\"UPC: \\(numberSystem), \\(manufacturer), \\(product), \\(check).\")\ncase .qrCode(let productCode):\n  print(\"QR code: \\(productCode).\")\n}\n\nThe code below is identical as above.

It also contains a gettable computed property, numberOfHearts. numberOfHearts is determined based on whether self is case or alive.\nenum Player: LifeSpan {\n  case dead\n  case alive(currentHeart: Int)\n\n  var numberOfHearts: Int {\n    switch self {\n    case .dead: return 0\n    case let .alive(numberOfHearts): return numberOfHearts\n    }\n  }\n\n  mutating func increaseHeart() {\n    switch self {\n    case .dead:\n      self = .alive(currentHeart: 1)\n    case let .alive(numberOfHearts):\n      self = .alive(currentHeart: numberOfHearts + 1)\n    }\n  }\n\n  mutating func getAttacked() {\n    switch self {\n    case .alive(let numberOfHearts):\n      if numberOfHearts == 1 {\n        self = .dead\n      } else {\n        self = .alive(currentHeart: numberOfHearts - 1)\n      }\n    case .dead:\n      break\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The break keyword is used to escape out of the switch statement.\n\nPlay Game\nLet us test. Begin with .dead.\nvar state = Player.dead // .dead\nstate.increaseHeart()  // 1\nstate.numberOfHearts // 1\nstate.increaseHeart() // 2\nstate.getAttacked()  // 1\nstate.getAttacked() // 0, .dead\nstate.numberOfHearts // 0\n\nCustom Operators (Taste)\nFirst design a enum, GameAction.\nenum GameAction {\n  case Start\n  case Pause\n  case Stop\n  case Restart(delay: Int)\n}\n\nCheck whether == works.\nGameAction.Stop == GameAction.Stop // Error\n\nYou may create your own operator.

That is good. You are challenged by new ways of thinking. However, you are right. You may not need to use enums. Just like protocols, it could be an overkill for certain implementations. In the following lesson, you will learn a recursive enum structure to add and multiply numbers. After, I will show you alternatives that are much simpler and more zen. Just like protocols, enums are not the ultimate savior. You have to learn and study every tool to a point you are able to calculate tradeoffs and benefits by foreseeing the future.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

In this lesson, you will discover how to create a complex enum structure using a recursive. Some may have not heard the term, \"recursive\" before. I will briefly show you what a recursive function is. Nonetheless, this lesson may be challenging.\nProblem\nEnum contains its own enum type\nRecursive Function\nLet us begin this lesson by learning about what a recursive function is.\nfunc recursiveFunction() {\n  print(\"Hi!\")\n  recursiveFunction() // loop\n}\n\nWhen you execute the recursiveFunction, it never ends.\nrecursiveFunction()\n// \"Hi'\"\n// \"Hi'\"\n// ...\n// \"Hi\"\n\nDesign Enum\nCreate an enum, ArithmeticExpression. It contains three cases with associated types. Two of the cases contain its own enum type, ArithmeticExpression.  The indirect keyword is needed to indicate that the enum is a special animal.\nindirect enum ArithmeticExpressions {\n  case number(Int)\n  case addition(ArithmeticExpressions, ArithmeticExpressions)\n  case multiplication(ArithmeticExpressions, ArithmeticExpressions)\n}\n\nYou may initialize using the number case or with addition or multiplication.\nArithmeticExpressions.number(4)\nArithmeticExpressions.addition(.number(4), .number(4))\n\nlet five = ArithmeticExpressions.number(5)\nlet four = ArithmeticExpressions.number(4)\n\nYou may create a recursive function to execute, addition and multiplication.\nfunc evaluate(_ expression: ArithmeticExpressions) -> Int {\n  switch expression {\n  case let .number(value):\n    return value\n  case let .addition(left, right):\n    return evaluate(left) + evaluate(right)\n  case let .multiplication(left, right):\n    return evaluate(left) * evaluate(right)\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: You may have to look at the function multiple times until you get it. Don't give up.\n\nLet us execute the function.\nevaluate(ArithmeticExpressions.number(4))\nevaluate(ArithmeticExpressions.addition(.number(4), .number(4))) // 8\nlet multiplicationEnumType = ArithmeticExpressions.multiplication(.number(4), .number(4))\nevaluate(multiplicationEnumType)  // 16\n\nAlternative Normal Enum\nA recursive enum to do addition and multiplication is an overkill. Let us use a normal one.\nenum Operation {\n  case addition(Int, Int)\n  case multiplication(Int, Int)\n\n  var result: Int {\n    switch self {\n    case let .addition(number1, number2):\n      return number1 + number2\n    case let .multiplication(number1, number2):\n      return number1 * number2\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nExecute.\nOperation.addition(4, 4).result\n\nHowever, I personally don't like the you have to use result to get the final value.\nAnother Alternative\nYou may create a struct along with functions.\nstruct StructOperation {\n  func addTwoNumbers(_ number1: Int, _ number2: Int) -> Int {\n    return number1 + number2\n  }\n  func multiplfyNumbers(number1: Int, number2: Int) -> Int {\n    return number1 * number2\n  }\n}\n\nExecute\nStructOperation().addTwoNumbers(4, 9)\n\nThis feels better. Yet, let us make it more zen.\nMy Choice\nUse closures instead.\nstruct MathOperation {\n  static let addition: (Int, Int) -> Int = { $0 + $1 }\n  static let multiplication: (Int, Int) -> Int  = { $0 * $1 }\n}\n\nExecute\nMathOperation.addition(10, 10) // 20\n\nThe best.\nSource Code\n7005_recursive_enum.playground\nReferences\nThe Swift Programming Language (Swift 3.1)\nConclusion\nOne of the code smells is \"needless complexity\". You don't need to be fancy. Remember, protocols and enums are double edged swords. If you don't know how handle them well, it may hurt or even kill you. In Chapter 8, you will learn in-detail about how an indirect enum works using a binary tree data structure.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to combine enums with generics.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

So far, you've learned how to create generic structs, classes, enums, and functions. Today, you will learn how to add generics within generics. Next, you will learn the meaning of indirect enums using the binary data structure.\nProblem\n\nLearn how to created nested generic enum\nLearn more about recursive enum with binary tree\n\nNested Generics\nLet us take your game to the next level with generics.\nBefore Swift 3.1\nTo appreciate nested generics, let us look into your/my past.\nDesign Generic Enums\nCreate two generic enums: Gadget and Company.\nenum Gadget {\n  case smartphone\n  case laptop\n  case fridge\n  case others(T)\n}\n\nenum Company {\n  case Samsung\n  case Apple\n  case Sony\n  case others(T)\n}\n\nDesign Struct\nCreate a struct called, Product. It contains three properties: company, gadget, and reviews.\nstruct Product {\n\n  let company: Company\n  let gadget: Gadget\n  let reviews: [T]\n\n  init(enterCompany: Company, enterGadget: Gadget, enterReview: [T]) {\n    company = enterCompany\n    gadget = enterGadget\n    reviews = enterReview\n  }\n}\n\nThe init method seems unpleasant. Let us attempt to initialize.\nlet myProduct = Product(enterCompany: .Apple,\n                                    enterGadget: .fridge,\n                                    enterReview: [\"Good, silver, but expensive\"])\n\nThere must be an alternative.\nSwift 3.1\nNow, you may add a generic type within a generic type. Create a generic struct, Team. Within the struct, it also contains another generic structure, TeamMember.\nstruct Team {\n  struct TeamMember {\n    let name: T?\n    let age: T?\n  }\n}\n\nLet us use nested generics using the Productexample.\nstruct NestedProduct {\n\n  indirect enum Gadget {\n    case smartphone\n    case laptop\n    case fridge\n    case others(T)\n  }\n\n  indirect enum Company {\n    case Samsung\n    case Apple\n    case Sony\n    case others(T)\n  }\n\n  let company: Company\n  let gadget: Gadget\n\n  let reviews: [T]\n\n  init(enterCompany: Company, enterGadget: Gadget, enterReView: [T]) {\n    company = enterCompany\n    gadget = enterGadget\n    reviews = enterReView\n  }\n}\n\n\nImportant: The indirect keyword is needed in front of Company and Gadget due to a bug. You will learn more about the meaning of indirect soon.\nCyclic Dependency: A relation between two or more modules which either directly or indirectly depend on each other to function properly. The tight coupling of the mutually dependent modules which reduces or makes impossible the separate re-use of a single module.\n\nLet us initialize using the generic enums\nlet myFridge = NestedProduct(enterCompany: .Apple,\n                                             enterGadget: .laptop,\n                                             enterReView: [\"Good\"])\n\nYou are following the principle: write less, produce more.\nRecursive Enum\nBefore I introduce you to the meaning of indirect, let us take a look the characteristic of enum associated value.\nFirst, let us design blueprints using class, struct, and enum.\nclass BobClass {}\nstruct BobStruct {}\nenum BobEnum {\n  case bobCase\n}\n\nLet us initialize\nlet bobClass = BobClass()\nlet bobStruct = BobStruct()\nlet bobEnum = BobEnum.bobCase\n\nCreate an enum, MyEnum, with associated value.\nenum MyEnum {\n  case myClass(BobClass)\n  case mySruct(BobStruct)\n  case myEnum(BobEnum)\n}\n\nLet us initialize.\nMyEnum.myClass(bobClass)\nMyEnum.mySruct(bobStruct)\nMyEnum.myEnum(bobEnum)\n\nLet us visualize.\n Reference vs Value Types in Associated Value\n\nNotes: The associated value of myStruct and myEnum are stored while myClass is referenced somewhere in the cloud.\n\nThe Meaning of indirect enum with Binary Tree\nLet us create an enum called, Tree. There are two cases, either Empty or Node. The Node case has associated value.\nindirect enum Tree {\n  case Empty\n  case Node(value: Int ,left: Tree ,right: Tree)\n}\n\nLet us create a couple nodes.\nlet tree1 = Tree.Node(value: 1, left: Tree.Empty, right: Tree.Empty)\nlet tree2 = Tree.Node(value: 2, left: Tree.Empty, right: Tree.Empty)\nlet tree3 = Tree.Node(value: 3, left: tree1, right: tree2)\n\nLet us visualize\n\nLet us add two more nodes\nlet tree1 = Tree.Node(value: 1, left: Tree.Empty, right: Tree.Empty)\nlet tree2 = Tree.Node(value: 2, left: Tree.Empty, right: Tree.Empty)\nlet tree3 = Tree.Node(value: 3, left: tree1, right: tree2)\nlet tree4 = Tree.Node(value: 4, left: tree3, right: tree5)\nlet tree5 = Tree.Node(value: 5, left: Tree.Empty, right: Tree.Empty)\n\nLet us visualize\n\n\nImportant: indirect enums no longer store associated value. It references. For instance, the associated value of tree4 has a reference to tree5 and tree3. tree3 has a reference to tree1 and tree2.\n\nRecursive Function to Sum Values\nLet us calculate the sum of every tree from the top using a recursive enum.\nfunc evaluateTree(tree:Tree) -> Int {\n  switch tree {\n  case .Empty:\n    return 0\n  case .Node(let value, let left, let right):\n    return value + evaluateTree(tree: left) + evaluateTree(tree: right)\n  }\n}\n\nLet us test.\nevaluateTree(tree: tree1) // 1\nevaluateTree(tree: tree3) // 6\n\n\nImportant: You may have to dissect the function multiple times to understand. I recommend you to start using a smaller node.\n\nSource Code\n8001_nested_generics_recursive_enum\nReferences\nGeneric struct crashes because of “cyclic metadata dependency\nMy Question on Stack Overflow\nConclusion\nThere were two objectives. First, you've learned how to design beautiful code with nested generics. Second, you've learned the difference between normal enums and indirect enums when it comes to associated value. Remember, indirect enums point rather than store. Some may be baffled by the recursive function to add the value of all nodes. Well, I can't help you much. I recommend you to start with one node and move up.\nIn the following lesson, finally, you will learn how to create custom operators.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

You will find out the why.\nDesign Functions\nFirst, let us design two functions.\nfunc nonThrowableFunc() {\n  print(\"From nonThrowable function\")\n}\n\nfunc throwableFunc() throws {\n  print(\"From throwable function\")\n  throw TestingError.randomError\n}\n\nDesign Error Case\nCreate an enum called, TestingError. It contains a case, randomError.\nenum TestingError: Error {\n  case randomError\n}\n\nCreate Throwable Function\nCreate a function, rethrowableFuncWithErrorHandling. It takes a parameter whose type is () throws -> (). Execute the parameter within the function block and use do-try-catch for error handling. At the end, the function is marked with \"rethrows\".\n\nNotes: Just bear with me for 30s.\n\nfunc rethrowableFuncWithErrorHandling(function: () throws -> ()) rethrows {\n  do {\n    try function()\n  } catch TestingError.randomError {\n    print(\"Random Error thrown by the function in the parameter\")\n  } catch {\n    fatalError(\"FATAL ERROR: Weird Error\")\n  }\n}\n\nPass Throwable Function\nLet us pass a throwable function to rethrowableFuncWithErrorHandling.\ntry? rethrowableFuncWithErrorHandling(function: throwableFunc)\n\n\nImportant: You can only use try within a do-catch block. Playground is messed up.\n\nPass Non-throwable Function\nYou may also pass a non-throwable function to rethrowableFuncWithErrorHandling.\nrethrowableFuncWithErrorHandling(function: nonThrowableFunc)\n\n\nImportant: Since the function, rethrowableFuncWithErrorHandling.is marked with rethrows, you may also enter a non-throwable function even though the parameter requires a throwable function. This is the why we, developers, do not even question the existence of the rethrows keyword.\n\nSource Code\n8003_advanced_error_handling\nConclusion\nCongratulations, you've mastered the Swift Error Handling. To recap, you may add the rethrows keyword to a function whose  parameter also can throws an error. However, you may still pass a non-throwable function since the original is identified as rethrows. This is the reason why we developers use APIs created Apple engineering without realizing that the original function may also throw an error.\nIn the following lesson, you will finally understand the statement, \"Swift is a protocol oriented language\".\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

Since Chapter 4, you've learned practical aspects of using protocols along with associated types and extensions. However, you haven't looked into how native types such as String, Int conform to default protocols pre-designed by Swift engineers.\nProblem\nUnderstand, \"Swift is a protocol oriented language\"\nEquatable\nString, Int, Double, and other native types conform to Equatable. Any type conforms to Equatable has a required method below.\nfunc ==(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool\n\nCustom Struct\nLet us create a struct, Blog and conforms to Equatable.\nstruct Blog {\n  let author: String\n  let title: String\n}\n\nextension Blog: Equatable {\n  static func ==(lhs: Blog, rhs: Blog) -> Bool {\n    return lhs.author == rhs.author && lhs.title == rhs.title\n  }\n}\n\nBlog objects have the == infix operator.\nlet firstArticle = Blog(author: \"Bob Lee\", title: \"Protocol AssociatedType\")\nlet secondArticle = Blog(author: \"Bob Lee\", title: \"Type Eraser\")\n\nfirstArticle == secondArticle // false\n\nCustom Tuple\nLet us create another struct called GridPoint.\nstruct GridPoint {\n  var grid: (Int, Int)\n  init(_ numberOne: Int, _ numberTwo: Int) {\n    grid = (numberOne, numberTwo)\n  }\n}\n\nLet GridPoint conforms to Equatable.\nextension GridPoint: Equatable {\n  static func ==(lhs: GridPoint, rhs: GridPoint) -> Bool {\n   return lhs.grid.0 == rhs.grid.0 && lhs.grid.1 == rhs.grid.1\n  }\n}\n\nLet us check.\nlet pointOne = GridPoint(4, 10)\nlet pointTwo = GridPoint(4, 10)\npointOne == pointTwo // true\n\nComparable\nMost number types such as Int, Double, conform to Comparable.\n10 > 5 // true\n10 = 100.0 // false\n\nRequired Method\nComparable inherits Equatable. Therefore, Self has to implement == as well.\npublic protocol Comparable : Equatable {\n  public static func  Bool\n  public static func  Bool\n  public static func >=(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool\n  public static func >(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool\n}\n\nEnum with Comparable\nCreate an enum called, OS.\nenum OS {\n  case iOS\n  case android\n}\n\nextension OS: Comparable {\n  static func ==(lhs: OS, rhs: OS) -> Bool {\n    return lhs == rhs\n  }\n\n  static func  Bool {\n    return rhs == .iOS ? true : false\n  }\n\n  static func  Bool {\n    return false\n  }\n\n  static func >=(lhs: OS, rhs: OS) -> Bool {\n    return false\n  }\n\n  static func >(lhs: OS, rhs: OS) -> Bool {\n    return lhs == .iOS ? true: false\n  }\n}\n\nLet us test.\nlet iOS = OS.iOS\nlet android = OS.android\n\n// iOS = android // false\n// iOS > android // true\n\n// android > iOS // false\n// android >= iOS // false\n// android \n\nImportant: iOS can not be equal to Android. It can be only greater.\n\nSource Code\n8004_equatable_comparable.playground\nResources\nswiftdoct.org/Array\nConclusion\nWe've taken a look at two popular protocols: equatable and comparable. You've learned that native Swift types such as Int, Double, conform to them and have required operators. After, you've learned how to create your own types that conform to equatable and comparable to provide the same effect with the native types.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn protocols that make a for-in loop possible.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

When it comes to learning new features, I've been using the microwave analogy that things just work because smart engineers have designed them. But, there are times you might have to create your own custom microwave. For example, you might want to create one for yourself during the winter because it's hard to code with frozen fingers. Then, you've got know all. In this lesson, let's find out the secret behind the Swift for-in loop and learn how to create our own custom types that have the magic.\nProblem\nWhat goes under the hood of a for-in loop.\nTake For Granted\nWhen you first learned Swift or other programming languages, you've probably used the feature below without giving a second thought. (I didn't)\nlet iOSSkills = [\"Swift\", \"UIKIt\", \"RxSwift\", \"TDD\"]\nfor skill in iOSSkills {\n  print(skill)\n}\n// Prints \"Swift\"\n// Prints \"UIKIt\"\n// Prints \"RxSwift\"\n// Prints \"\"TDD\"\"\n\nLet us convert a String value into CharacterView and loop each character.\nfor character in (\"Bob the Developer\").characters {\n  print(character)\n}\n// \"B\"\n// \"o\"\n// \"b\"\n// ...\n// \"r\"\n\n\nImportant: The Swift for-in loop exists since Array and CharacterView both conforms to Sequence and IteratorProtocol.\n\nBehind the Scene\nFirst, the iOSSkill, whose type is Array conforms to Sequence, has the required method, makeIterator. The method returns an object that conforms to IteratorProtocol. The returned object has a required method called, next() which returns the next element with an optional type.\nvar skillIterator = iOSSkills.makeIterator()\n\nwhile let skill = skillIterator.next() {\n  print(skill)\n}\n\n// Prints \"Swift\"\n// Prints \"UIKIt\"\n// Prints \"RxSwift\"\n// Prints \"\"TDD\"\"\n\nIt also applies to Array.\nlet numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7]\nvar numbersIterator = numbers.makeIterator()\n\nnumbersIterator.next()\nnumbersIterator.next()\nnumbersIterator.next() // Optional(5)\nnumbersIterator.next()\nnumbersIterator.next()\nnumbersIterator.next()\n\nCustom Type\nSequence Protocol\nLet us create our own struct that conforms to Sequence.  The struct is called, MyCountdown. The struct has the required method, makeIterator. The method returns an object that conforms to ProtocolIterator.\nstruct MyCountdown: Sequence {\n  let start: Int\n\n  func makeIterator() -> CountdownIterator {\n    return CountdownIterator(self)\n  }\n}\n\nIteratorProtocol\nLet us create a struct, CountdownIterator that conforms to IteratorProtocol.  The struct contains the required method, next() which returns an element.\nstruct CountdownIterator: IteratorProtocol {\n  let countdown: MyCountdown\n  var times = 0\n\n  init(_ countdown: MyCountdown) {\n    self.countdown = countdown\n  }\n\n  mutating func next() -> Int? {\n    let nextNumber = countdown.start - times\n    guard nextNumber > 0\n      else { return nil }\n\n    times += 1\n    return nextNumber\n  }\n}\n\nTesting\nLet us find out if the makeIterator and next methods work.\nvar threeTwoOne = MyCountdown(start: 3)\nvar iterator = threeTwoOne.makeIterator()\niterator.next() // 3\niterator.next() // 2\niterator.next() // 1\n\nMagic\nThe MyCountdown. is eligible for the Swift for-in loop.\nfor count in threeTwoOne {\n  print(\"\\(count)...\")\n}\n\nSource Code\n8005_sequence_iterator.playground\nResources\nSwift Standard Library Functions\nSwift Change Log\nSwiftdoc.org\nReferences\nAPI Reference - IteratorProtocol\nRay Wenderlich - Building Custom Collection Swift\nProtocols in Swift by Chris Eidhof\nHow To Conform to the Sequence Protocol - Natasha The Robot\nConclusion\nFirst, you've learned the hidden implementation by the Swift for-in loop. To make types eligible for the magic, it has to conform to the Sequence protocol and has the required method that returns an object that conforms to IteratorProtocol. The iterator object also has the required method of next() to get the next element. The word sequence sounds as if types must look like a dictionary, array, or set. It doesn't have to. Again, the purpose of this lesson was not introduce you to various protocols. It was to let you know how native types conform to pre-written protocols and has added features like a for-in loop. If you wish to study, I recommend you to take a look at the references and read the documentation.\nIn the following lesson, you will learn how to execute swift files using Terminal and how Xcode sends error messages, a.k.a, the red marks.\n\nNote: Learn Swift with Bob is available on Udemy.

It returns either true or false.\nassert(true) // pass\n\nLet us create a function that may return assert(false).\nfunc enterName(name: String) {\n  if name == \"\" {\n    assert(false, \"You must enter a full name\")\n  } else if name == \"Bob\" {\n    assert(false, \"There is only one Bob\")\n  }\n}\n\nenterName(name: \"Bob\")\n// Error\n\nHere is another example.\nvar expectedResult = 10\nvar actualResult = 10\n\nassert(actualResult == expectedResult, \"The actual result doesn't match with the expected\")\n\nYou may use #file and #line\nprint(\"File: \\(#file)\")\nprint(\"Line: \\(#line)\")\n\nAssertionFailure\nIt destroys no matter what.\nimport Foundation\nlet randomNumber: Int = Int(arc4random_uniform(3))\n\nswitch randomNumber {\ncase 0, 1, 2:\n  print(randomNumber)\ndefault:\n  assertionFailure(\"Unexpected index \\(randomNumber)\")\n}\n\nIf randomNumber contains any number besides 0, 1, 2, it will crash the program.\nPrecondition\nIt is identical to Assert. However, it is also called when Swift is compiled at -0.\nlet expectedNumber = (1, 3)\nlet actualNumber = (1, 3)\n\nprecondition(actualNumber == expectedNumber, \"\\(actualNumber) is not the same as \\(expectedNumber)\")\n\n\nNote: I don't recommend using Precondtion or PreconditionFailture since the user has no idea what the error is.\n\nPreconditionFailure\nIdentical as AssertionFailure. It is called during -O.\nFatalError\nIt is useful for terminating an app no matter what.\nlet number: Int = Int(arc4random_uniform(100))\n\nfunc enterNumberReturnString(index: Int) -> String {\n  switch index {\n  case 0, 1, 2:\n    return \"\\(number)\"\n  default:\n//    assertionFailure(\"Unexpected index \\(number)\")\n//    abort()\n    fatalError(\"Unexpected index \\(number)\")\n  }\n}\n\n\n@noreturn, the compiler confirms that the marked function will not return.

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\nAvoid inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic binding and other complicated OOP concepts. Use delegation and simple if-constructs instead.\nUse simple brute-force solutions first instead of complicated algorithms. Slower algorithms will work in the first place.\nFor slightly unrelated but rather small pieces of functionality use private methods instead of an additional class.\nYAGNI\nAvoid Creating a YAGNI (You aren’t going to need it) - You should try not to add functionality until you need it.\nLaw of Demeter\nThe Law of Demeter (LoD) or principle of least knowledge is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs.\n\nEach unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units \"closely\" related to the current unit.\nEach unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers. Only talk to your immediate friends.\n\nElaboration\nAny section of code (code block, function, class, etc) should minimize the dependencies on other areas of code. This is achieved by using shared variables as little as possible. Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured computer system and a good design, and when combined with high cohesion, supports the general goals of high readability and maintainability.\nEliminate, minimize, and reduce complexity of necessary relationships.\nBy hiding implementation details, coupling is reduced.\nHide Implementation Detail\nHiding implementation details allows change to the implementation of a code component while minimally affecting any other modules that use that component.\nA software module hides information (i.e. implementation details) by providing an interface, and not leak any unnecessary information.\nYou may follow a couple principles:\n\nMinimize accessibility of classes and members.\nDon’t expose member data in public.\nAvoid putting private implementation details into a class’s interface.\nDecrease coupling to hide more implementation details.\n\n\n\nBoy-Scout Rule\n\"Leave the campground cleaner than you found it”.
