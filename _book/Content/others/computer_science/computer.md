## What is a CPU
The Central Processing Unit. All hardware components and programs must pass data through the CPU before carried out.

# How Computer Memory Works


# How Flash Memory Works
Flash memory is used for easy and fast information storage in computers, digital cameras, and video game consoles.


The **Bit Size** of a CPU tells you how many bytes of information it can access from RAM t the same time. For example, a 16-bit CPU can process 2 bytes at a time, a 64-bit CPU process 8 bytes at a time.

**Megahertz** is a measure of a CPU's processing speed, or clock cycle, in million per seconds. So, a 32-bit 800-MHz Pentium III can potentially process 4 bytes simultaneously, 800 million times per second.

## System RAM
System Ram speed is controlled by **bus width** and **bus speed**. `Bus width` refers to the number of bits that can be sent to the CPU simultaneously, and the `bus speed` refers to the number of times a group of bits can be sent each second. A `bus cycle` occurs every time data travels from memory to the CPU.

In reality, RAM doesn't operate at optimum speed. `Latency` changes the equation radically. It is the number of clock cycles needed to read a bit of information. To compensate for latency, CPUs use a special technique called `burst mode`.
