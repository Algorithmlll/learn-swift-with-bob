# Execution

### Focus
My company must be HR driven. We care about people and feelings. We do the unscalable, and inspire others. As as the CEO, must care about my employees. I may have to resort to radical decision making to a point where my employees depend on my decision and work. I need to have a celebrity skill, a skill that attracts eyes of many. At the same time, I'm going to be the CEO of a company.

Freedom. You may go to Facebook, Skype, and so on. But, you need to know why you are there.

Executive retreats, annual conference,

### Work Hours
It's free. You may go home anytime you want. People should work from morning to night. However, it's up to you if you have to go home early. After 5, you may stay up. There is no more 9-5. Engineers should spend time on doing what they love and keep learning on their own You may form a group and lead an interesting project that would help people. Create special groups of people trying to innovate.

Deadlines are not the most important things because we always fail, and fast doesn't mean good. What we have to care is progress and process. Are we doing something better than yesterday? If we continue to produce value for the company, deadlines do not matter as much. Final products do not matter.

## CEO
As the CEO, every word matters. It creates a significant impact on employees.
