<p>Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future. You can buy on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006230125X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=006230125X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=iosgeekcommun-20&amp;linkId=8d211420683dc307d2059f0a1ec1c6a6" target="_blank">Amazon</a></p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-elons-world">Chapter 1: Elon&apos;s World</h2>
<p>He jumped right into dot-com mania in 1995, fresh out of college. He founded a company called Zip2 which is Google + Yelp. Compaq bought Zip2 IN 1999 FOR $307 million. He made $22 million. Paypal then was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Musk then threw $100 million into SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla, $10 into SolarCity.</p>
<p>With Space X, Musk had to deal with the government just like Steve Jobs had to go against recording companies when he first launched iTunes and iPod. He said, &quot;My family fears that the Russians will assassinate me&quot;. Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help you share baby photos, Musk wants to save the human race from self-imposed or accidental annihilation.</p>
<p>Must has taken industries like aerospace and automotive that America seemed to have given up on and recast them as something new and fantastic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the heart of this transformation are Musk&apos;s skills as a software maker and his ability to apply them to machines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As his ex-wife, Justine, put it, &quot;He does what he wants, and he is relentless about it. It&apos;s Elon&apos;s World, and the rest of us live in it.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-africa">Chapter 2: Africa</h2>
<p>The public first met Musk in 1984 as a 12 year old. He designed a video game called, &quot;Blastar&quot;. He required 167 lines to run. When Elon Musk was a baby, as his moms, &quot;He goes into his brain, and then just see he is in another world. He still does that. Now I just leave him be because I know he is designing a new rocket or something.&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Must has ended up thinking that his brain has the equivalent of a graphics chip. It allows him to see things out in the world, replicate them in his mind, and imagine how they might change or behave when interacting with other objects. He had complusion to read. &quot;It wasn&apos;t unusal for him to read two hours a day,&quot; said Kimbal. When school ended at 2pm, he stayed at the bookstore until 6pm.
</code></pre><p>His parents got divorced. Kimbal and Elon lived with his father. His father Errol was a talented engineer. Both brothers visited Erro&apos;s engineering jobs and learned how to lay bricks, install plumbing, fit windows, put electrical wiring. However, Elon Musk like the father. He describes, &quot;He is good at making life miserable&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;You get chased around by gangs at school who tried to beat the shit out of me, and then I&apos;d come home, and it would just be awful there as well. It was just like nonstop horrible.&quot;</p>
<p>He wanted to avoid joining the military, he has said, because it would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime. What rarely talked about it he attended the University of Pretoria for 5 months and dropped out.</p>
<p>Zip2 was acquired by Compaq. Elon Musk gained 22 million dollars at the age of 27. He bought a $1 million McLaren.</p>
<p>He invested $12 million into X.com, leaving him after taxes, with $4 million or so far personal use.  In X.com, customers received a $20 cash for signing up and a $10 card for every person they referred. More than 200,000 people bought into it. Thiel became the CEO while Elon Musk was on the plane. He rebranded X.com as PayPal.  However, Elon Musk kept investing, and he became the largest stakeholder. When Paypal was bought by eBay at 1.5 billion dollars, Elon Musk netted about $250 million or $180 million after taxes.</p>
