   1. Compared to several popular web programming languages (Python, Ruby), Swift is a fast and safe language. It executes as native code.
   2. It is a strongly typed language and, with the use of optionals, you can make sure that you will never have any null pointer errors.
   3. Unlike other safe languages (Java or C#), it is more expressive. It is a great way to build something quickly, while making sure that you do not go and have to make sure that you have the assistance of the compiler to help you: 1) build an application that does not crash all the time, and 2) make sure that you can speed up your own application development
   4. Developers love Swift. Bringing Swift to more platforms is always exciting.
