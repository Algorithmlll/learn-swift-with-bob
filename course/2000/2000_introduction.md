# Advanced Object Oriented programming
Welcome back. You must be ready to learn because I'm ready and pumped. Although I expect you to have a basic understanding of Object Oriented Programming, I just wanted to make sure we are on the same page. So that when we build apps in Part 2 and Part 3, you know what I'm talking about. For those who feel confident with OOP, but you want to maximize its potential, you've come to the right place.

Remember, OOP is at the heart of the iOS ecosystem. You can't go against it. It's like death, shadow, and tax. You can't make apps without using OOP because that's what Apple engineers have designed this platform to be. For instance, `UIViewController` contains numerous properties and methods and super classes associated with it.

You will be surprised the power of Object Oriented Programming that allows you to write modular and dry code just after going through this chapter with me. Let's get started.
