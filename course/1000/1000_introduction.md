# Introduction

## The Swift Fundamentals
Welcome to the first chapter of Learn Swift with Bob. I've chosen topics that make Swift such a unique language. For instance, you and I are going to learn every `?` and `!` that exist in this language. If you've been frustrated by the red marks that appear on the left of your screen, you've come to the right place with me, Bob the Developer. Let's get started. If you have any questions, feel free to comment below.

> Mention that everything we will be practical and every iOS developer must know all. There is no excuse.
