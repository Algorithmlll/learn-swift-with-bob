## Credentials
 - Reciprocity:
I've been giving out content for free for the since 2016 November. I've been helping and hundreds of thousands developers all around the world through my blog. I care and I want to help.

 - Scarcity:
You are going to be able find anything like this on the internet. The full complete Swift tutorials for intermediate such as Generics, enum, protocl, functional? It tooks me thousands of hours for me to learn all these concepts as Swift is my first programming langauge. You will not going to find anything like this. Also,

 - Authority:
 I've been a tutor for the last 5 years in my life teaching students in various topics in Math, Chemistry, Biology, and programming. I have mover 10,000 developers follow me on my blog, and gets a couple thousands developers visit my blog and read my tutorials. They come, because not only I provide great value for in exchange for their time but also humor and fun.

 - Consistency:
If you've been to my blog and saw, look, if you really want to get better and move to the next level for real, you've come to the right place.

 - Liking:
Swift is first programming language, and I'm young, and I still don't know much, but I know how you feel. Closures, completion handlers? Those are tough. I've taken course online such as Devslopes, Treehouse, Lynda, but none of them cover the basic fundamentals. If you gotta know how enum works, the meaning of trailing closures and @escaping closures. They are must. Come on, if you don't take this course, you are missing out.

 - Clearly state the why. Like Apple, change the world. People buy into my dream and vision.
 - Scarcity
