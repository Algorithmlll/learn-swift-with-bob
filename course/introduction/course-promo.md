## Outline
### 1. Course Image Placeholder (3 seconds)
### 2. Welcome & Instructor Bio (20 seconds)
 My personal story - dropped out and fou
 - Credential - medium followers, hundreds thousand views on monthly basis - in just few months of blogging. The number and review speaks for itself
 - I have a tutor for a long time.

 I've been a tutor for the last 5 years in my life teaching students in various topics in Math, Chemistry, Biology, and programming. I have mover 10,000 developers follow me on my blog, and gets a couple thousands developers visit my blog and read my tutorials. They come, because not only I provide great value for in exchange for their time but also humor and fun. (Authority)


### 3. Benefits and Pain (20 seconds)
Many student lack fundamentals becasue many courses and books focus on final products. They ended up being code monkeys including myself. I know becasue Swift is my first programming language and I feel you.
no single online course for intermediate swift developers
Its hard ti watch with your phone.
No source code available

- Mention pains that many students go through (Completion handlers, closures, protocol, generics, enum) and relate with the readers through my own experience (liking)
- Talk about how this course can help them solve, and what makes this course special from the rest in the marketplace (scarcity)
- Talk about myself: My growth and work I've been producing. Talk about my purpose and why I've started teaching iOS development. (Authority and reciprocity)
- Call to action to them to my course by mentioning their past encounter with my blog articles (Consistency). Again, mention what problems they would face if they decide to ignore, while talk about benefits they can with. Give an impression that they can't do much without me. Fear.

- Clearly state the why. Like Apple, change the world. People buy into my dream and vision.
- Scarcity

> Goal: The reader must buy into my goal and vision

You dont know what completion handlers, retain cycle, memory management in delegate, autoclosure, enum result type, autoclosure, capture list, rethrow? Do you know when yo use as, as? as!, try? Try, and try?

### 4. List of Components (20 seconds) - explain the benefits of the approach,
- My default is 28px- i also have a pointer and zooming effect for better user experience
- Entire book is available with source code. You may use it as a reference even when you take a shower since phones nowadays are water proof (show humor)
- No more boring reading and typing. I type right next to you all day. You will see me coding. You can see my face
- My lessons are prepared from top to bottom, almost no unexpected error and you wont waste time typing. You save time.

### 5. what the students will do
 - The student will learn how to program and out come in a different playing field.
 - You will learn the best practices in the iOS development
 - Clearly state what makes this course different. Focus on the "benefits" and customer oriented
 
### 6. Ideal student students for this course
Either you've programmed with Swift  and understand the basic concept of Object Oriented Programming.

### 7. Call to action
 - Being an iOS developers in Sillicon Valley makes 6 figures yet bootcamps are still expensive over $1,000 - 3000 depending on the region. Or you are just doing it for fun.  you can ask questions and get help at any moment from me its only $50. The internet is plebty. All of my information I learned from the internet for the last 6 months and and dropping out of college as an engineering student. B
 - No discount will be applied unless If you are a student or from third world countries, you may send me an email to get discounts.

## Goal
Impression of Bob
 1. His first programming language is Swift so he understands how we feel
 2. He is only 20 years old and he dropped out from college. He must have a big goal behind of his intention
 3. He has over 10,000 followers and 100,000 monthly visitors in just about 4 months? People must be liking him alot!
 4. He seems like a cool dude. He is a type of a guy who will get a lot of girls. He's got everything and he encourages us to.move up as well
