### Instructor Introduction
Welcome to the Intermediate to Advanced Swift 4 course. My name is Bob Lee, a best selling iOS instructor with the highest rating of all time with over thousands of daily visitors to my [blog](https://blog.bobthedeveloper.io). I've spoken at various Swift conferences. I also work as the content distributor of the largest [iOS Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/apple.ios.developers) with over 100,000 weekly reach.

### What the Students Would Learn
The course covers the 4 pillars of the Swift Programming Language. Object-oriented, protocol-oriented with type erasers and associated type, value-oriented programming with structs and enums, and lastly functional-oriented programming with generics and closures. You will also fully understand how memory is managed in iOS development and learn the difference between `weak`, `strong`, and `unowned`. In the last chapter called. "Advanced Swift",  you will learn what makes a `for-in` loop possible by studying the `Sequence`, `Equatable` protocols. The course covers a lot more including intro to test-driven-development and how the delegate and singleton pattern works.

This course isn't just about learning the unique features of Swift 4. I made this course to shift your framework how you approach coding. Most students lack the fundamentals because they buy into the courses that focus on the final products, They say, "Be a paid developer by building 21 apps." We had enough of those savvy marketing tactics. It simply doesn't work. If that was the case, iOS developers would not get paid that much. When you the take this course with me, I promise It's not going to be an easy path, but you will certainly enjoy the process of becoming better and 5 times more confident with your code.

### What the Students Get Which Other Courses Do Not Offer
- The student experience matters.  Along with the 28px font size and zooming and pointer effects, you have no problem watching the lecture even on iPhone SE.
- Your questions will be answered at 100%.
- You will have life-time access to the eBook which contains source code, explanations, resources, and references for your own studies. You don't need to memorize anything. You may use it as a review while learning and when you are done with the course.
- You can see my face while learning. Feel my energy.
- My lessons are prepared from top to bottom. There is no unexpected error and you won't waste any time. I respect your time.
- You will be invited to the private Slack group.
- I'm from South Korea. For non-native English speakers subtitles are finally available for every video including this one.
- Lastly, the best seller. Udemy approves.

### Ideal Students
This course is designed for those who have a prior experience with Swift or other languages such as Javascript and Objective-C and understand the minimum basic concept of `Object Oriented Programming`, `else-if` and `switch` statement. If that's not the case, don't worry. I've attached entire free beginner's lectures for you on my Youtube channel.

### Call to Action
Unlike many other courses, I have not signed up for the Udemy's marketing plan. The course is priced at $50 which I believe its the appropriate price for the value you receive in return. However, if you are a student or an aspiring iOS developer from third-world countries, feel free to send me a message. I will provide you with the private coupon link. Lastly, there is a 30-day money back guarantee. If the course isn't the right fit, I will pay you back. If you are not convinced yet, feel free to read through the entire reviews to decide whether the course worths the price. If you want to become an advanced Swift developer building scalable and maintainable codebase, enroll the course right now.
