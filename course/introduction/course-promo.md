### Instructor Introduction
Welcome to the only intermediate to Advanced Swift 4 course. My name is Bob. I love being an iOS blogger and instructor as [Bob the Developer](https://blog.bobthedeveloper.io) with over thousands of daily visitors. I've spoken at various Swift conferences. I also work as the content distributor of the largest [iOS Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/apple.ios.developers) with over 100,000 weekly reach.

### The Why
If you've been learning Swift from other sources and you felt like you are missing out the fundamentals while building iOS apps and you feel overwhelmed by the complexity of Swift, you've come to the right place. I understand because I have conducted over thousands of personal surveys. Many wanted to write beautiful code that doesn't violate the DRY principle and clean architecture.

In the course, you will not just learn how to use certain Swift features. You will why those features have been adopted and how you can apply the behind principles in your current projects.

### What the Students Would Learn
The course covers 4 pillars of the Swift programming including object-oriented, protocol-oriented, value-oriented programming with structs and enums, and lastly functional programming. You will also fully understand how memory is managed in delegates, closures, and the difference between `weak`, `strong`, and `unowned`.
In the last chapter, you will default protocols such as `Sequence`, `Equatable`.

In fact, this course isn't just about Swift. You will shift entire framework how you approach coding. Most students lack fundamentals because many courses and books focus on the final products. You've probably heard or taken, "Be a paid developer and build 21 apps just by taking one course." Give me a break. You know what happens. They end up being code monkeys, copying and pasting. I'm speaking from my experience.

### Why Should You Take
- The user experience matters. My default font is 28px along with zooming and pointer effects. No problem watching it on your smartphone.
- Your questions will be answered at 100%
- The entire eBook is available for your lifetime with source code, explanations, resources, and references. You may use it as a review even when you are done with the course.
- My presence matters. You can see my face while learning.
- My lessons are prepared from top to bottom. There is no unexpected error and you won't waste time looking me trying to figure out what's going on.
- You will be invited to the private Slack group.
- Lastly, the best seller. Udemy approves.
- Subtitles are availble :)

### Ideal Students
This course is designed for anyone who has been programming with Swift or other similar languages such as Javascript and understand the basic concept of `Object Oriented Programming`, `else-if` and `switch` statement. If you've never programmed before, don't worry. I've attached free introductory videos for you in the lecture notes.  

### Call to Action
Unlike many other courses, I have not signed up for the Udemy marketing plan. The course priced at $50 which I believe its the appropriate for the value you receive in return. However, if you are a student or you are an aspiring iOS developer from third-world countries, feel free to send me an email at bob@bobthedeveloper.io. I will provide you with private coupon links. I understand at one point in my life, I grew up one of those places.

Lastly, there is a 30-day money back guarantee so just give it a try. You have nothing to lose. If you are not convinced yet, feel free to read through the reviews, and decide after.
