# Resources
I've prepared a list of resources that would maximize your learning potential. I want you to succeed.

### Lecture Notes
I've created an online ebook which contains source code, explanations, resources, and references.  The website is mobile-friendly so that you can study Swift even in the bathroom since phone these days are water-proof. You may also use it as a reference of itself  since it supports searching on the top left corner.

### Group Chat
You may join Bob the Developer Slack Group and help one another. If you wish to join, you may send me an email at `bob@bobthedeveloper.io `. I will send you an invitation link. The group remains exclusive. You might have to wait 24-48 hours since I have to check the email one by one.

### Supporting Articles
I have attached  articles and references that I use to prepare for this course. Feel free to use them to further study on your own which I expect.

### Updates
I share detailed updates with my readers and students on the [Facebook Page](https://facebook.com/bobthedeveloper). To get to know me as a personal level, you can follow my story on Instagram [@bobthedev](https://instagram.com/bobthedev).

Let's move on to what's covered in this course.
