# Resources
I've prepared a list of resources that would maximize your learning potential. I want you to succeed since you are my student.

### Lecture Notes
You may download the source code for each lesson and review. It contains code snippets and short descriptions. The website is mobile-friendly so that you have no excuse not studying Swift. You may also use it as a reference since it supports searching on the top left corner.

### Group Chat
You may join Bob the Developer Slack Group and help one another. If you wish to join, you may send me an email at `slack@bobthedeveloper.io `. Based on the email, I will send you an invitation link. The group remains exclusive. Quality trumps everything else.

### Supporting Articles
Since Nov, 2017, I've been publishing one article per week on my [blog](https://blog.bobthedeveloper.io/). I've have chosen topics that would allow my students to refer to them while taking this course.

### Social Media
I share detailed updates with my readers and students on [Facebook Page](https://facebook.com/bobthedeveloper). To get real-time update, you can follow my story on Instagram [@bobthedev](https://instagram.com/bobthedev).
