# What's Next
You've successfully completed Learn Swift with Bob. Let us have a virtual high five. Since you got started I said, you would come out programming in a different playing field if you follow the path I've designed for you. If that has happened, let me know on the review.

You and I have attacked primarily what makes Swift a unique language compared to any others.

You've learned one of the most confusing and difficult concepts as such detecting memory leak within closures and delegates. You've tasted functional swift.

You've learned how to design completion handler blocks
Generic protocols.


Preparing and documenting take up about 80% of all the work to produce a course but I still did create a document for you because I care and I want you to learn. I understand the principle that the more value I provide, the better result I can from my students.
