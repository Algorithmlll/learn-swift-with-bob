# What's Next
You've successfully completed Learn Swift with Bob. Let's have a virtual high-five. When you got started, I promised, you would come out programming in a different playing field if you've follow the path I've designed for you.  If that has happened, let me know on the review.

You've learned one of the most confusing concepts as such detecting memory leak within closures and delegates. You've tasted functional swift. You've learned how to design completion handler blocks. Generic protocols, and so on. There are just too many you've gone through. If you've come this far, you are one of less than 5% who completed this course. I'm very proud of you. You've got a bright future.

Here is the thing. We haven't made a real app yet. As I have been referring multiple times, the next course is `The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob`. Yu will learn how to build apps using  Protocol Oriented reusable cells, enum oriented along with Realm Database. If you join the waiting list at LearnSwiftwithBob.com, I may give you discounts if you join the [waiting list](https://boblee.typeform.com/to/cEW6rb). You will get a couple discounts and updates time to time.

If you've finished the entire course, feel free to talk to me or send me an email at `bob@bobthedeveloper.io`. If you also want to get a real-time update from me, you may follow my story on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/bobthedev).

Keep learning. See you soon in the next course.
