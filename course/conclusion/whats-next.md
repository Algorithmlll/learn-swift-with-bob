# What's Next

## Last Remarks
You've successfully completed Learn Swift with Bob. Here is a virtual high five. When you got started, I said, you would come out programming in a different playing field if you follow the path I've designed for you. If that has happened, let me know on the review.

Through the course, you've learned what makes Swift unique compared other languages. You've learned too much that I don't want to repeat.
You've learned one of the most confusing concepts as such detecting memory leak within closures and delegates. You've tasted functional swift. You've learned how to design completion handler blocks. Generic protocols, and so on.

Here is the thing. We haven't made a real app yet. Guess what, as I've saying multiple times, the next course is `The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob`. I may give you discounts if you join the [waiting list](https://boblee.typeform.com/to/cEW6rb).

If you've finished the entire course, feel free to talk to me or send me an email at `bob@bobthedeveloper.io`. If you also want to get a real-time update from me, you may follow my story on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/bobthedev).
