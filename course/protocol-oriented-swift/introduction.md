# Chapter 4
## Protocol Oriented Swift

Welcome to Chapter 4, Protocol Oriented Swift. The primary focus of this chapter is to understand how to produce  a non-nested, value-oriented, highly scalable codebase. In Lesson 1, you will learn the syntax of Swift `protocols`. In Lesson 2 and 3, you will see the flaws of type casting and inheritance by comparing with the protocol way . In the last lesson, you will learn how to pass data between classes through utilizing `delegate`.

> **Disclaimer:** You will not understand the statement, "Swift is a protocol oriented language" until you get to Chapter 8..
