## Sitting at Starbucks
**Sat, Feb 4th, 2017 | 20 Years 172 Days**

From today, I've decided to reveal much besides one thing I cherish the most. I think that goal is too holy to the point I can't dare to share with anyone but myself.

Since 16th Sept, 2016, it has been approximately 105 days. It's amazing how much I've come within the short amount of time. When I first arrived in Seoul, Korea, I still remember I was roaming around, both my mind and body. I was ready to work, but I didn't know where to get started. I went to the library almost daily for 2 weeks. I grabbed books on web development and iOS development.

Today, I will have uploaded an article. I lifted 155 pounds 7 reps when benching. It's my PR.

Writing a diary helps me with focusing, and just relax with my own. I also want to write a biography in the future, so it would help me document.

> **Reflection:** Although I do not see the final line, I can't stop. No one fucking can stop me from marching forward.


## Gary
**Mon, Feb 6th, 2017 | 20 Years 174 Days**

I met my cousin, Jae Hyun, and bought The Art of The Deal. I looked into AI, Machine Learning, and how jobs will be lost. I start realizing that's the path I'm going with. This is the future. People are too negative. Imagine what AI brings to us. You can use robots to introduce museum products. Imagine robots walking on the street and you may ask questions. It's thrilling. I want to be a part of the world in which I create those. I want to be the leader. Fuck, I'm pumped man. Gary, you are my hero. Gary tells me not to consume. Start doing. Stop discussing. Test and learn. Test and learn. Do it over and over. Stop taking meaningless theory based Udemy courses. Just do it. And, I'm doing it

> **Reflection:** Get back to the reading habit and study more AI, Backend, iOS, and so on. Avoid negative people. Cut them out.

## The Art of the Deal
**Tue, Feb 7th, 2017 | 20 Years 175 Days**

Things are getting settled. I've finished up decorating my learning journey document. I've been sleeping 6 hours for the past 3 days. That would be 42 hours out of 168 hours. I just can't imagine sleeping for 24-30 years until we die. I think it's been working pretty alright. I'm adapting to it. I used to sleep 7 hours a day, but I just want to prove the world that you don't need 7-8 hours to go all hard throughout the day. It more has to do with mentality as long as you are getting 6 hours of quality sleep per night. I have also been sleeping at 3am nowadays. I will try to sleep around 12am so that I can wake up around 6am and stick to my schedule which I've designed to produce the maximum amount of work within this short period of time. I just can't waste time much. Yesterday, I bought `The Art of the Deal` by President Trump. I've read about 100 pages so far, and I remember this clearly that before he decides to buy any property, he hops onto a couple taxis and ask questions about the city since the drivers know much better. He also believes that we need to know how to use media to brand himself. He is just a motivating figure to me despite what people say about him. He is always on the offense, and he is willing to do anything to achieve what he wants within the boundary of law. Right now is 10:46AM. Tomorrow, I will try to wake up at 6am. I've also figured my marketing strategy as inspired by Gary's tactic called, "Jab Jab Hook". I try to provide as much as value possible. I've reached approximately 7000 followers on Medium. It has been increasing 100 per day, but nowadays the increase has gone down to 70 to 80. I could make more viral posts, but the problem is I want to create tutorials which I can always use them if anyone asks me questions. So, I will stick with making quality tutorials. Things are getting better. I love it. I will continue to produce great content and value for my readers. I also sent 20-30 emails today. I helped 4-5 people today. It's about building relationships. I'm on the right path. Do the unscalable which no one wants to try.

>**Reflection:** Not only you have to work hard, but you have to work smart. Donald's Trump's father was also a developer, but he focused on building brick walls, as supposed to Donald Trump's billion dollar buildings. It's not just about how long you work. Always read, research, test, learn.

## Personal Website
**Tue, Feb 8th, 2017 | 20 Years 176 Days**

I have always wanted to have a personal website because I needed to sell ebooks and courses. I've found a great startup which provides that links for me. It also has an affiliate link. This is awesome. Today I read a picture book about the life of the 3rd President in Korea. He used to be a soldier for Japan when she annexed Korea during WWII. He was in the office for 16 years with dictatorship. One thing I respect from him is that he was always a top student, but also I had vision since he was young.

Anyway, it was descent day. I want tomorrow to be a better day. I focus on three things: 1. Blog 2. Books 3. Udemy. I focus.
