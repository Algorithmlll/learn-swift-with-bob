## Sitting at Starbucks
**Sat, Feb 4th, 2017 | 20 Years 172 Days**

From today, I've decided to reveal everything besides one thing I cherish the most. I think that goal is too holy to the point I can't dare to share with anyone but myself.

Since 16th Sept, 2016, it has been approximately 105 days. It's amazing how much I've come within the short amount of time. When I first arrived in Seoul, Korea, I still remember I was roaming. My mind and my body. I was ready to work, but I didn't know where to get started. I went to the library almost daily for 2 weeks. I grabbed books on web development and iOS development.

I will have uploaded an article.
I lift 155 pounds 7 reps when benching. It's my PR.

Writing a diary helps me with focusing, and just relax with my own. I also want to write a biography in the future, so it would help me document.

> **Reflection:** Although I do not see the final line, I can't stop. No one fucking can stop me from marching forward.

I met my cousin, Jae Hyun, and bought The Art of The Deal. I looked into AI, Machine Learning, and how jobs will be lost. I start realizing that's the path I'm going with. This is the future. People are too negative. Imagine what AI brings to us. You can use robots to introduce museum products. Imagine robots walking on the street and you may ask questions. It's thrilling. I want to be a part of the world in which I create those. I want to be the leader. Fuck, I'm pumped man. Gary, you are my hero. Gary tells me not to consume. Start doing. Stop discussing. Test and learn. Test and learn. Do it over and over. Stop taking meaningless theory based Udemy courses. Just do it. And, I'm doing it

> **Reflection:** Get back to the reading habit and study more AI, Backend, iOS, and so on. Avoid negative people. Cut them out.
