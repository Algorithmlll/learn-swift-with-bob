# Personal Learning Journey
I try to share what I learn and teach. Since this is more like a documentation rather than a tutorial, explanations could be terse. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me for any further explanation. 

Current Study Materials 
 * MVVM (In-Process)
 * Protocol Oriented Programming with TableView (In-process)
 * Bluetooth Low Energy (In-process)

> You may find some of my learning materials written in tutorials in my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/bobthedeveloper) Channel and [blog](https://medium.com/@bobleesj)
