# iOS Development {#ios}
I try to stay consistent and provide as much as value for my students and readers. I also focus on building long-term relationships over short-term sales. You may find all of my tutorials and articles I've written for you guys. Also, you may find [gadgets](Resources.md#gadgets) that I use to increase my productivity.

# Gadgets {#gadgets}
These are products that I use to increase my productivity along with [keyboard shortcuts](productivity/keyboard_shortcuts.md).

| Gadget | My Usage | Category |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Portable 15.6 Inch Full HD Monitor] | I use it to carry around when I travel. This monitor doesn't require a power cord. It needs a USB port | Monitor |
| [Acer 23.8 Inch Monitor] | It's affordable, and I use it to record tutorials and any other activities. A dual screen is a must for anyone who is serious about programming | Monitor |
| [MacBook Pro 15 Inch] | I don't think I have to explain. But, the link provides the cheapest offer for now | Laptop |
| [Xiaomi 10000mAH] | I carry it everywhere because I blog and make tutorials with my phone. | Charger |
| [Apple's Magic Keyboard] | When I have my mac and monitor, it feels more comfortable for me to type using a bluetooth keyboard instead reyling on my Mac because I often get a neck-ache | Keyboard |
| [Apple's Magic Mouse 2] | I just how I can scroll between desktops without using the trackpad. It also looks aesthetic and I can carry it in my pocket otherwise I had to carry a small bag | Mouse |

# Software {#software}

### Hosting and Cloud Computing

| SaaS | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Digital Ocean] | I use it to run virtual servers. It's more affordable than Google's |
| [Bluehost] | I use it to host my website and purchase my domain name |  

[Digital Ocean]: https://m.do.co/c/bb7f34dbec72
[Bluehost]: https://www.bluehost.com/track/bobthedev


### Learning
| Platform | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Treehouse] | If I need to devour information, I use Treehouse since it provides a free trial, and I can consume as much as information due to the subscription model. I started my first programming journey with Treehouse. |

[Treehouse]: http://treehouse.7eer.net/c/350498/228915/3944

### Finance
| Platform | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [TransferWise] | It disrupts the way banks send money. It's decentralized so the international wire transfer occurs within a day or two and it's cheap if you are dealing with money less than $10,000 |

[TransferWise]: https://transferwise.com/u/217271

### Schedule & Events
| Platform | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Calendly] | This is my favorite scheduling tool. You don't need to buy a premium account. It's free to use. It allows you to set date and time blocks when you are available, when you send your profile link to someone else, the person can choose the time based on their time zone. I use it all the time for scheduling. You can see my schedule [here](https://calendly.com/boblee).  
| [Timo] | I've used Evenbrite to organize and schedule events. But, Tito provides a seamless experience for me. The landing page looks great. I recently purchased a ticket for the upcoming Swift conference. |

[Timo]: https://ti.to/home
[Calendly]: https://calendly.com

### Documentation
| Platform | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Gitbook] | I'm currently using Gitbook to document. It allows me to allow Markdown seamlessly with my favorite Text Editor and Github. If you want to get started, feel free to watch this [tutorial](https://toolchain.gitbook.com). I also use it to share my lecture notes for [The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob] |

[Gitbook]: https://gitbook.com
[The UIKIt Fundamentals with Bob]: https://bobleesj.gitbooks.io/udemy_uikit_fundamentals_notes/content/

### Website
| Template | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Jupiter Wordpress Theme] | I recently bought this theme to create my own [personal website](http://bobthedeveloper.io) without having to write a single line of code because it provides pre-made and highly customizable drag and drop elements. You can find out what you could possibly create this theme [here](http://preview.themeforest.net/item/jupiter-multipurpose-responsive-theme/full_screen_preview/5177775).  |

[Jupiter Wordpress Theme]: https://themeforest.net/item/jupiter-multipurpose-responsive-theme/5177775?s_rank=1&ref=bobthedeveloper

### Communication
| Apps | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Inbox by Gmail] |  I love using this app instead of relying on iPhone's default mail or Gmail. The app automatically organizes items into separate groups through machine learning, and I cant archive or read the entire group with a single swipe. As a person who receives a number of comments on social media, this app is just perfect for me |
| [Discord] | Although Slack is okay, I use Discord because it's free for unlimited users. It's heavily used by gamers since it provides channels for voice calls. But, it also provides syntax and markdown highlighting. In fact, I have a group for my students to interact with each other.

[Inbox by Gmail]: https://www.google.com/inbox/
[Discord]: https://discord.gg/


### Feedback and Survey
| Platform | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Typeform] | I used to use Google Form, but Type form looks a little more engaging because it provides interactive experience and you can also add payment |

[Typeform]:https://www.typeform.com


### Video Editing
[Adobe Premier Pro and Aftereffect](http://www.adobe.com)

### Project Management

| Platform | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Wrike] | Wrike is an ideal project management solution for teams and businesses of all sizes: from solopreneurs and small startups to Fortune 500 firms. |
| [Trello] | Trello provides an overview. I use it to organize my weekly work. |

[Wrike]: https://www.wrike.com/?r=R4w9e0Hw
