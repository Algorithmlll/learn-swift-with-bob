## About
My name is Bob. I'm from Korea. I grew up in Vietnam, Malaysia, and lived in the US. I'm 20 years old, and I recently paused going to school after getting rejected to transfer my degree from Chemical Engineering to Electrical Engineering.

On Sept 16, 2016, I landed on my home country. I currently teach how to programs and make their own apps. I've started off with iOS.

I have a learning journey note, and I document every learning opportunity and write a diary.

I love playing basketball played competitively both in high school and college. As a result, I've developed a competitive mentality.

In the Q1 of 2017, I write books, make online courses on Udemy, and write blog articles. Most importantly, I engage heavily with my readers and fans. I offer help.

I do not complain. I do not regret on my decisions even if that has led to failure. Every failure is a new opportunity granted for me. Getting rejected to transfer my major was the luckiest event ever happened in my life. However, I plan to go back to school next summer to pursue a degree in computer science to study Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and mathematics with a clear vision.
