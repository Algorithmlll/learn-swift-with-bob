## Chapter 1: Elon's World
He jumped right into dot-com mania in 1995, fresh out of college. He founded a company called Zip2 which is Google + Yelp. Compaq bought Zip2 IN 1999 FOR $307 million. He made $22 million. Paypal then was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Musk then threw $100 million into SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla, $10 into SolarCity.

With Space X, Musk had to deal with the government just like Steve Jobs had to go against recording companies when he first launched iTunes and iPod. He said, "My family fears that the Russians will assassinate me". Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help you share baby photos, Musk wants to save the human race from self-imposed or accidental annihilation.

Must has taken industries like aerospace and automotive that America seemed to have given up on and recast them as something new and fantastic.

> At the heart of this transformation are Musk's skills as a software maker and his ability to apply them to machines.

As his ex-wife, Justine, put it, "He does what he wants, and he is relentless about it. It's Elon's World, and the rest of us live in it."

## Chapter 2: Africa
