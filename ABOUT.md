# About
I'm 20 years old, and I was born in Korea, raised in Malaysia, Vietnam, and the lived in the US. I'm currently in Seoul, Korea. Next year, I plan to go back to school to pursue a degree in Computer Science in the US. I'd like to study Machine Learning, AI, and VR technology. I speak Korean and English.

# Goal
My dream is to provide affordable education channels for all people regardless of gender, religion, sex, race, color, and wealth. Since Sept 17, 2016, I've left college in NYC to pursue this goal. Currently, I have started off with teaching how to make iOS apps and Swift programming language. In 2017, I attempt to raise as much as funds through teaching so that I can start a company and work with smart engineers to disrupt the current education system.


## Current Focus
I aim to become the #1 iOS Blogger on Medium.

## How to get there
1. Initiate and reach out to people, ask questions, make recommendations, offer to help, and pitch my ideas
2. Compete with those way ahead of me: `Devslopes`, `Rob Riches`, `Udemy`, `Udacity`, `Treehouse`, `CodeAcademy`, `RayWenderlich`, `AppCoda`.
3. Hustle everyday. No basketball. No hangout more than once a week. No day off. No girlfriend.

## Mission Statement
I, Bob the Developer, can achieve anything if I show up every day, practice everyday, and improve every day. I learn to contribute. I believe in good karma
