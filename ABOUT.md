## The Why
My dream is to provide affordable education channels for all people regardless of gender, religion, sex, race, color, and wealth. Since Sept 17, 2016, I've left college in NYC to pursue this goal. Currently, I have started off with teaching how to make iOS apps and the Swift programming language. In 2017, I attempt to raise as much as funds through teaching so that I may build a company that provides a platform for learning.
