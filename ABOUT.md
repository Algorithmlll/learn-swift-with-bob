## The Why
My dream is to provide affordable education channels for all people regardless of gender, religion, sex, race, color, and wealth. Since Sept 17, 2016, I've left college in NYC to pursue the vision. I have started off with teaching iOS Development with the Swift programming language. In 2017, I attempt to raise as much as funds through teaching to a startup which provides a learning platform.
