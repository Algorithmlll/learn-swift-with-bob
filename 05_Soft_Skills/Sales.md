Liking
- 3 Important factors

    - 1. People who are similar to us
    - 2. People who pay us complements
    - 3. People who cooperate with us
- Before you begin agreements, try to share information for each other.

Consensus

- Rather relying on own ability, point out how others are doing already.

Social Currency — People like looking smart in front of their friends. Create something that helps them do that and they will share it with others.
Trigger — People share things that are top of mind and tip of tongue, e.g., the terrible song “Friday” by Rebecca Black seeing a spike in views every Friday.
Emotional — Create something that stirs people’s emotions and it will spread. They have to be high arousal emotions, e.g., anger, awe, and joy. Think Donald Trump. For better or worse, he’s a master at tapping into high arousal emotions, which is why you can’t escape hearing his name on a daily basis.
Practical — People like helping people. This is why people share “how to,” type content.
Public — Your content, product, or idea has to be visible for people to share and talk about it.
Story — People learn through stories and love hearing them. If you’re able to master storytelling you have massive power and an unfair advantage.

Best Methods to Build Rapports
November 14 2016
Rapport: Rapport is built through by feeling of commonality
We feel the spark. Too many people rely on words as to get rapport with each other. Only 7% is important. We mirror each other. People like people who are like themselves.
“People like people who are like themselves; or who are like how they like to be”.

“고객은 내 지갑을 보는 세일즈맨을 원하지 않는다. 고객은 내 마음을 보는 세일즈맨을 원한다."
“유아복점에서 근무하는 이은영 매니저는 전국적으로 매출 상위 1% 안에 드는 판매량을 기록해 ‘에이스 메니저’ 라는 명예의 전당에 오른 사람이다. 그녀는 임신한 여성이 초기에 매장에 와 충동구매를 하려고 하면 고객을 말린다. 앞으로 선물이 많이 들어올 테니 너무 성급하게 사지 말고 막달에 다시 오라고 조언한다. 그러면 판매자 진심을 알아본 고객은 나중에 반드시 다시 찾아오고 단골 고객이 된다는 것이다.

"The world revolves around me. Me, me, me. My favorite person: Me."

I don’t want email from you. I don’t want junk mail from you. I want me-mail. — Seth Godin

1) Personalized email. Do you homework and get to know them at a personal level.
2) Know their network. Get a warm introduction.

1) The straightforward subject
“You’ll enjoy this new diet research” good,
“Thought you might like this” no good.

Prepare for rejection (Prepare for around 10 rejections)

Small Talk
I like your accent, where are you from?

LinkedIn Connection

(Insert their name) -hello. We haven’t spoken in a while, but I hope all is well with you and your family. I noticed in LinkedIn that you are connected to Bill Thomas, VP of Sales at ABC company. I was recently downsized at my company and would be grateful for an active introduction to Bill. Would you be willing to help me connect with him? Perhaps we could meet up over coffee to catch up first. Let me know what works for you. Thanks in advance for your help.

I wanted to thank you again for the encouragement and support you gave me as we connected during my job search this past year (my company closed last December). Although I am still looking for a job in the Atlanta area, I know I will find it and have had a lot to be grateful for during my journey to it. One major gift was that I had time to handle things for my dad, who had some major health issues this year and is doing better now.

Just in case you happen to hear of anything that might be a fit for me, I'd love to use my communication and organization skills to make a difference in some area connected to education, health and wellness, or safety, but I'm open to possibilities. (I like helping people connect to information and resources, coordinating activities, and monitoring compliance.)

I love sharing great resources, and here are several TED talks that are my current favorites: [links]

Warm wishes for a safe and happy holiday season!
